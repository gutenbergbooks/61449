<h2><span class="h2line1">Preface</span></h2>
<p>In this tale of Greece in the fifth century B. C.,
fact and fiction are so closely intervolved that
a detailed explanation of their respective boundaries
would be both tedious and superfluous.
Suffice it to say that I have with reluctance
departed from history only when the narration
of the personal affairs of the characters made
it necessary to do so. The difficulty of accurate
adherence to historical facts seems insuperable.

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;In gay hostility and barbarous pride,</p>
<p class="t0">With half mankind embattled at his side,</p>
<p class="t0">Great Xerxes comes to seize the certain prey,</p>
<p class="t0">And starves exhausted regions in his way.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="lr">Samuel Johnson.</p>
</div>
<p>The reddening glow of an evening sun was shed
upon the little town of Anthela in Locris as
Zopyrus, a young Persian officer in the army of
Xerxes passed quickly from the shadows of the temple
to Demeter into the narrow street. In his general bearing
and physique he was truly a Persian; large of
frame, broad of shoulders, with a proportionally small
but well poised head. But the tight clusters of blond
curls, clear blue eyes and sensitiveness of mouth were
not distinguishing traits of Persian parentage. There
was a seriousness in his expression far in advance of
his years which may have numbered four and twenty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>As he walked with swinging gait toward the Persian
encampment, he turned his gaze in the direction
of the ridge of Oeta whose northern slope silhouetted
against the ruddy glow of an evening sky, approached
the Malaic gulf. At any other period in his life the
beauty of his surroundings would have called forth his
admiration, but the scenes of the past two days which
had been here enacted, had completely quelled the natural
&aelig;sthetic tendencies of his soul. Here he had
been a witness to the slaughter of Persian and Greek;
he in whose veins flowed the blood of both peoples.</p>
<p>As he neared the encampment another officer clad
in the familiar close-fitting leathern tunic of the Persian
army hailed him. He was a giant in stature, a
man born to command. It was he who had charge of
the cavalry. Zopyrus recognized him at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, Masistius! Does this beautiful June evening
summon you forth too? Truly a fair land is Hellas.
Amid such surroundings as these the annals of Persia
had been different!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time darkness had descended and as
Masistius surveyed the landscape an exclamation of
spontaneous admiration burst from his lips, soldier
though he was and unused to the gentler phases of
life. Oeta cast its purple shadows across the Malaic
gulf, whose waters now reflected countless stars, and
in the shrubbery about the two soldiers were heard the
mournful notes of the little owls, so common in this
strange land. Occasionally the call of birds of prey
grated on their ears and brought to their minds the
loathsome fact that amidst all this entrancing loveliness
of nature, death had come to hundreds of their
countrymen and allies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>&ldquo;Friend Zopyrus, although I am a soldier through
and through, I am not blind to the beauties of this
land of Greece, but sterner things brought me out
tonight. I came to summon you to the presence of the
king who wishes to speak with you. Artabazus and
I were in the royal tent talking over the plans of the
morrow when Xerxes suddenly commanded a slave to
summon you to his presence. The order took both
Artabazus and myself quite by surprise, for we have
not been blind to the fact that Xerxes has avoided you
since the very beginning of this campaign. Why he
should do so, I cannot imagine. It has always seemed
to me that the king has quite overlooked the physical
prowess and ability of his cousin Zopyrus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zopyrus shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;True my
father was Artaphernes, satrap of Sardis and brother
of Darius Hystaspis, but you must remember my
mother was only a Greek from Miletus, although her
parents were both Athenians of noble blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can subdue the Greek within you, for
surely the influence of your royal father is the
stronger,&rdquo; said Masistius.</p>
<p>Zopyrus turned his gaze to the bejeweled vault of
the heaven. A lie is an unpardonable sin to a Persian,
and to that extent Zopyrus displayed his paternal
heritage, but there rose before his eyes the vision of
a beautiful woman with classic features whose last
words to him before her death had been: &ldquo;Zopyrus,
it is my earnest desire that sometime you go to Greece,
to Athens, and there acquire some of the culture of
that freedom-loving people in that fair land. Here in
Persia you will always be the victim of oriental
despotism.&rdquo; As he grew older Zopyrus realized that
his mother&rsquo;s words and the past influence of her life
had been instrumental in causing him to hate not only
the vain-glorious idolatry of the Persian court, but
the weakness, licentiousness and tyranny of the Persian
king. Zopyrus looked again at his companion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will go at once to Xerxes,&rdquo; he said, completely
ignoring the other&rsquo;s remark.</p>
<p>The tent of Xerxes was in the center of the encampment
to insure its protection in case of an unexpected
attack from the enemy. An Ethiopian slave
parted the hanging folds as Zopyrus approached and
held them as he passed into the interior. Seated upon
a throne covered with richly woven tapestry and surrounded
by slaves and courtiers sat the monarch of
Persia.</p>
<p>Zopyrus never knew in what mood he would find
his royal cousin. At times the king was most amicably
inclined toward his subjects, upon which occasions he
lavished upon them generous gifts; at others, the punitive
aspect of his authority was made evident, and his
dependents were punished out of all due proportion
to their offenses.</p>
<p>Xerxes&rsquo; eyes followed the noble figure of his
cousin with impatient tolerance as the latter bowed
and performed the customary greetings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you just previous to your meeting
with Masistius?&rdquo; questioned the king abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the town of Anthela,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there not a temple to that pagan goddess,
Demeter, there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well stay away from such temples except for
the purpose of destroying them. By the way, Sikinnus,&rdquo;
he called, summoning a slave, &ldquo;take that rascal,
Tyrastiadas, who tried to desert today and give him
forty lashes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>Xerxes turned again toward the son of Artaphernes
whose splendid physique and heroic mein
summoned his reluctant admiration. Here he realized
were unlimited possibilities for his army, for he sincerely
believed Zopyrus to be a braver man than Mardonius
or Artabazus, though he was many years their
junior; then too he had respect for the independent
air of this cousin who did not dog his footsteps with
flattering remarks and hints for the promise of favors
at the close of the war. So it was with a more deferential
air that the politic Xerxes addressed his next
remarks to his cousin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zopyrus, you are too big a man to be in command
of only one hundred soldiers. At your age your
half-brother, Artaphernes, together with Datis, led the
expedition which resulted in the battle of Marathon.
If at the close of this battle with the Greeks in this
pass you prove your valor, you shall be placed in
command of one thousand men. Also I will allow you
to choose among the fairest maidens of the kingdom
for a wife, and for exceptional bravery I will give
you a satrapy.&rdquo; All eyes were turned to Zopyrus
who acknowledged his king&rsquo;s favor with a slight bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bear in mind,&rdquo; continued Xerxes, &ldquo;that your
mother was a Greek, though she was a lawful wife of
your father. It is this taint of blood that has stood in
the way of previous honors, but with courage such as
becomes the son of a noble Persian you may be able
to make me forget completely the plebeian maternal
blood.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>Anger such as had never before been experienced
by Zopyrus surged within him at this insult to his
mother&rsquo;s memory, but he held it in subjection, merely
bowing stoically before the ruler.</p>
<p>Xerxes had one dominating motive in attempting
to win Zopyrus&rsquo; fidelity. At the beginning of the campaign
he had secretly wished to cause his cousin&rsquo;s
death because he had feared him, but the latter&rsquo;s
advice when consulted on matters of doubt, forced him
to the opinion that Zopyrus might become quite an
asset to the Persian army if properly handled. That
he, Xerxes, had failed in this he did not know.</p>
<p>At this moment the slave who stood at the entrance
to the royal tent approached his master with
these words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most noble king, a Greek soldier waits without
and would have word with you alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bid him enter,&rdquo; was the monarch&rsquo;s response.</p>
<p>The courtiers quickly withdrew by a rear exit,
Zopyrus passing out last. Moved by a sudden impulse
and unnoticed, he quickly and silently re-entered the
tent and stood a few feet behind the throne in the
shadows. The canvas at the front entrance parted
admitting the figure of a Greek soldier. He had removed
his helmet and left his shield and javelin without
in respect to the Persian monarch. Armed only
with his short sword and wearing the characteristic
scaled cuirass and leather greaves of Greek military
dress he presented an interesting sight to both Persians.
His head was uncovered, displaying the artistic
hair-dress worn by the young men of Athens and
Sparta. Long thick braids were crossed at the back
of his shapely head and fastened together with a jeweled
pin in front. From beneath the braids his brown
hair lay in soft waves around his temples. His face
was fair almost a degree of effeminacy and his figure
of average height indicated graceful outlines even
though concealed by the armour he wore. He addressed
the king:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>&ldquo;O Xerxes, king of the Medes and Persians and
would-be conqueror of the world, I come to you with
a message of greatest importance! For two days your
brave soldiers have met defeat at the hands of the
Greeks at the entrance to the pass of Thermopyl&aelig;. Now
the Greeks are so inferior in number, owing to the
celebration of certain religious festivities which are
soon due to come to an end, that right now is the time
to strike, but not in the method which you have up
till the present employed, when only a handful of men
from each side could meet and enter into personal
combat. The Greeks are well trained and if they are
to be vanquished, it must be by the superior forces of
the enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king with offended dignity clutched the arms
of his throne and raised himself, crying out in angry
tones: &ldquo;Am I to have a Greek tell me that my army
lacks the military discipline of the Greeks?&rdquo; Here he
rose with an exaggerated attempt at majesty, &ldquo;Behold,
O Greek, Zeus himself in the form of an earthly monarch
come to lead the whole race of mankind to the
destruction of Greece!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>To Zopyrus&rsquo; amazement as he stood a silent and
unobserved figure in the shadows, as well as to the
amazement of Xerxes himself, the Greek did not
tremble at the king&rsquo;s words. An amused expression
not without disdain passed over his fearless countenance.
Xerxes&rsquo; face became purple with rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of my sight grinning fool of a Greek,&rdquo; he
roared, &ldquo;before I have your tongue cut out for your
insolence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zopyrus stood rooted to the spot in horror, but the
graceful unemotional figure of the Greek remained unchanged.
To Zopyrus it seemed an eternity before the
young man spoke, but in reality it was almost immediately.
He drew nearer the throne by a couple of
paces, and Zopyrus feared for his life in that proximity
to the wrathful monarch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, O Xerxes, if you would succeed in overwhelming
your foes you must attack them from behind,
but this you can not do since you are unacquainted with
this wild, impassable country. I am a native Malian
and well acquainted with this locality. If you could
make it worth my while, I could show you a mountain
pass that would lead you to the rear of Leonidas&rsquo; army
unobserved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the Greek was speaking Xerxes&rsquo; expression
gradually changed from malice to pleased attention:
&ldquo;And suppose, friend Greek, I do not permit you to
leave unless you reveal to me this pass!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Greek smiled. &ldquo;It is impossible simply to
tell of this secret way, for it is beset with many dangers,
such as almost impenetrable growths of underbrush,
impermeable morasses and almost inaccessible
cliffs. A native guide is absolutely essential and <i>I</i> am
that guide who will receive my pay before the journey
commences.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>The king nodded in affirmation and sank back quite
dazed from the effect of the interview. The Greek was
still unmoved and continued: &ldquo;I will lead your army
tomorrow night, as it is safest to travel under cover
of darkness. We shall probably reach the other side
of the pass at a very favorable time of day, when the
market-place of the town is filling. I will meet you
here tomorrow at sunset in Persian uniform, and except
to your most important commanders, I wish to
remain unknown. Till then, O Zeus, farewell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He passed quickly out of the bewildered kingly
presence, and Zopyrus took advantage of this moment
to make a hasty and unseen exit at the rear of the royal
tent.</p>

<p class="lr">Simonides.</p>
</div>
<p>Like a great crawling serpent, the army of
Xerxes, augmented by the cowardly Thessalians,
wound its circuitous and perilous way from
Trachis; first ascending the gorge of the river Asopus
and the hill called Anop&aelig;a, then crossing the pitch-dark,
oak-covered crest of Oeta. Its venomous head
was the treasonable Greek, dressed as a Persian foot-soldier.
Many were the woes of that nocturnal journey!
Soldiers tripping over fallen branches and entangled
in the undergrowth were trampled to death.
Some were pressed into the treacherous morass, but
the malignant monster, heedless of this sloughing,
crept on toward its goal which was the town of Alpeni
at the east end of the pass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>But the small army of the Greeks was not destined
to suffer such a complete surprise as Xerxes had hoped,
for the revengeful Tyrastiadas, limping painfully as a
result of his forty lashes, had succeeded in deserting
and had apprised Leonidas of the startling fact that
the Persians were coming across the pass. The Spartan
king sent a Phocian guard of one thousand men
to prevent the enemy from crossing the summit of
Oeta, but this guard was speedily overwhelmed by the
Persians who were under the leadership of Hydarnes.
The next morning shortly after sunrise, the Persian
hordes descended upon the Greeks. The sun was reflected
with dazzling brilliancy from thousands of
breast-plates, spears, shields and helmets, and upon
the ears of the heroic sons of Hellas fell the deafening
war-cry from myriads of throats.</p>
<p>A suffocating sensation seized Zopyrus as he beheld
the mere handful of Greeks bravely awaiting certain
death at the hands of a pitiless foe, but to turn
back was now impossible. Strange that he could in
fancy so easily picture himself as one of that brave
minority, awaiting inevitable death! To his own sorrow
he had not infrequently lamented the faculty which
he possessed of seeing the praiseworthy aspect of an
enemy&rsquo;s view-point. It was this attribute of leniency
toward the opinions of his fellow-men that was especially
irritating to the intolerant Xerxes. In the mind
of the latter all men were divided into two great
classes; subjects and enemies. To Zopyrus all men
seemed friends unless by their own initiative they
proved themselves otherwise. It was extremely painful
to him to see these brave Greeks meet this great
crisis unflinchingly. It was humanly impossible for
this mere handful of men to stem the tide of the onrushing
Persians.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>To us at this day and age it is apparent that these
men did not sacrifice their manhood in vain. The result
of any noble act is never lost. In some way and
at some time it brings a result as satisfactory as that
desired in the hearts of the original heroes themselves.
Such a result was destined to come to Greece after the
bones of Thermopyl&aelig;&rsquo;s warriors had long mingled with
the dust.</p>
<p>Zopyrus was swept on by the barbarian host. A
shower of missiles diminished the number of Greeks
and soon the enemy was upon them and the battle continued
with spear and sword. Zopyrus received a
slight wound on the left shoulder, the Greek inflicting
the injury snatching away his spear. Zopyrus quickly
unsheathed his sword, pressing his opponent to closer
combat as a better chance for self defense. The two
fought long over the bodies of Persian and Greek who
now lay in inevitable amity beside their once ruthless
foe. At length the Greek who was little more than a
boy, weakened perceptibly and in an unguarded moment
Zopyrus&rsquo; sword disappeared up to the hilt. As
the lad fell his helmet rolled off revealing a countenance
of incomparable beauty; deep-set eyes, brows
that nearly met above a straight nose, refined mouth
and a contour of cheek and chin that was flawless. All
this was revealed to Zopyrus in a second&rsquo;s time, but it
left an indelible impression on his mind. As he pressed
on he felt that the horrors of war were crazing him,
and his soul cried out against the awful brutality of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>With the slaughter of the three hundred the gateway
to central Greece had now been forcibly opened
and Xerxes in imitation of his father&rsquo;s avenging
words, cried out, &ldquo;Remember the Athenians.&rdquo; A
journey of about six days lay between the oriental
despot and his ultimate goal, the city of Athens, so with
prancing steeds, waving plumes, glittering arms and
triumphant shouts, the Asiatic legions resumed their
deleterious course.</p>
<p>The morning of the third day found the army
within sight of Mt. Parnassus. With rapt gaze Zopyrus
beheld the softest sculpture of cliff and peak against
a cerulean sky. Upon yonder lofty summit dwelt the
Muses, those daughters of Zeus who preside over the
&aelig;sthetic and intellectual aspirations of man. It seemed
to Zopyrus that surely now but one Muse, Melpomene,
occupied that pinnacle, and with mournful gaze beheld
the invasion of this fairest of lands.</p>
<p>In accordance with the order of Xerxes all faces
were turned in the direction of Delphi, in spite of a
report that the oracle of Delphi had prophesied that
Apollo would protect his sanctuary. Through a gorge
at the foot of Mt. Parnassus might Melpomene have
seen the multitudes of Asiatic troops pursue their nefarious
journey. Suddenly peal after peal of thunder
reverberated from the apparent calm of a mid-summer
sky. Then great crags from the mountain were loosened
and rolled down upon the army which fled in wild terror,
abandoning its attempt to plunder Delphi. So
did Apollo protect his shrine! But fortune did not so
favor the citizens of Thespi&aelig; and Plat&aelig;a in B&oelig;otia
both of which were ravaged and those citizens who
would not join the Persian forces were put to death.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>At length on the fifth day the army camped at
night-fall outside of Athens. It was a beautiful intense
dark blue Athenian night in which heaven&rsquo;s vault
seemed to blaze with innumerable jewels. Zopyrus sat
at the door of his tent deep in his own thoughts. An
army during its marches and battles must think, talk
and act as one being, and that one subservient to its
leader, but who shall say in the stillness of evening
each living entity which comprises that vast unit shall
not have his individual dreams, and those thoughts
which render him distinct from every other living being?
And Zopyrus as he sat in the darkness, thought
of Athens and of his mother. What would she think
if she knew he was approaching Attica&rsquo;s stronghold as
a plunderer and devastator! Conflicting emotions
surged within his soul. Once again it seemed to him
that he was in the far off Hermus valley, strolling by
the little stream of Pactolus, and by his side was the
austere Artaphernes whose stern visage was turned
toward him with an expression of paternal rebuke.
The vision faded leaving him troubled and sore at
heart.</p>
<p>That night Zopyrus had a dream. It seemed to
him that his father appeared and beckoned silently to
him to follow and that he wonderingly rose and obeyed.
When they were out in the open, Artaphernes, who
Zopyrus noticed was fully armed, pointed with his
sabre toward Athens and repeated the memorable
words of Darius, &ldquo;Remember the Athenians.&rdquo; Suddenly
the shade of his mother appeared to the right.
She stood holding on her arm a scroll of papyrus, and
while Zopyrus looked she pointed with it in the same
direction as that indicated by the sabre of his father
and behold, as Zopyrus turned he saw a beautiful city
with numerous buildings of white marble, and in the
center a temple-crowned hill. In the streets were many
busy people hurrying to and fro. Some talked from
the temple steps while the populace listened, some vied
with each other in various physical sports and others
sold the produce of the soil in the bustling marketplace,
but whatever their occupation, they represented
a happy and contented democracy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Marveling at this vision, Zopyrus turned to his
father and noticed that the sabre now pointed to the
east. Following the direction of its keen blade with
reluctant eyes, Zopyrus beheld another city more
gorgeous, but totally lacking in the refined beauty
which characterized the city which lay to the west.
The buildings of this eastern city possessed a massiveness
and grandeur that inspired in the beholder a profound
awe. Upon the throne in the magnificent palace,
and surrounded by a court retinue, sat a tyrant to
whom all bowed in servility. On the streets the people
moved and worked <i>en masse</i>. There was no individuality,
no differentiation, for these people were victims
of an oriental despotism.</p>
<p>When Zopyrus opened his eyes the palace and the
toiling people had vanished and so likewise had the
vision of the peaceful republic. The Persian father
and Greek mother no longer stood before him. The
youth knew that this dream represented the Persian
and the Greek at war within himself for the supremacy.</p>
<p>When morning broke, the camp was astir at an
early hour for this was to be the day of days! Zopyrus
was awakened by the stamping and neighing of
horses, the rattle of arms and the jocular voices of
his comrades.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up, Zopyrus!&rdquo; cried a friendly voice.
Zopyrus saw his friend Masistius leaning over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xerxes bids us avenge the burning of Sardis today,&rdquo;
continued Masistius. &ldquo;His words to all his officers
this morning are, &lsquo;Remember the Athenians!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His advice to me is quite unnecessary,&rdquo; replied
Zopyrus, &ldquo;for I can not forget them.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Defense on the Acropolis.</span></h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Dim is the scene to that which greets thee here,</p>
<p class="t0">Prompting to worship, waking rapture&rsquo;s tear,</p>
<p class="t0">Yes, rise, fair mount! the bright blue heavens to kiss,</p>
<p class="t0">Stoop not thy pride, august Acropolis!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="lr">Nicholas Michell.</p>
</div>
<p>The city of Athens was seething with excitement,
for the news had just been received that the
Greek soldiers had been unable to hold the pass
of Thermopyl&aelig;. The streets were filled with groups
of agitated old men, women of all ages, and children,
who seemed no longer capable of being controlled by
reason. Weighted down by the burdens of their personal
property they prepared to flee. But whither!</p>
<p>In the center of a group near the Areopagus, at
the foot of the Acropolis on the north-west, were
gathered about fifty men, women and children intently
listening to the counsel of one to whom they turned at
this time. He was a man of venerable countenance,
flowing beard, and wore a white <i>chiton</i> with a handsomely
embroidered Greek border.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;let us make haste
to the top of the Acropolis, there to defend our temples
and to seek refuge within the &lsquo;wooden wall.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Some of his audience seemed inclined to take his
admonition seriously, others hesitated as if in doubt.
Presently a man whose personality was felt before he
was actually visible came hurriedly into the group. He
possessed a commanding bearing, noble face, an eye
piercing and full of fire. There was decision in the
swift gestures of his shapely hands. This man was
Themistocles, the most powerful Athenian of his time.
It was he who had persuaded his fellow-citizens to increase
their navy at the time of the war with Aegina,
and who sincerely believed that the future safety of his
country lay with the ships which were now anchored
in the bay of Salamis.</p>
<p>He approached with dignified air the terrified
gathering of Greeks, and there was an imperious ring
in his voice as he addressed the spokesman of the
group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kyrsilus, can you not persuade these people to
come to the bay at once where some of the ships will
conduct them safely to Salamis till all danger from this
invasion is past?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To his surprise the old man answered haughtily.
&ldquo;I am trying to prevail upon these frightened people
to seek refuge behind the &lsquo;wooden wall&rsquo; as the Delphic
oracle warned us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;wooden wall,&rsquo;&rdquo; shouted Themistocles, &ldquo;is
not the Pelasgic wall which surrounds the top of the
Acropolis. It is a wall of ships, and by this means
alone will the people of Athens find refuge. Come!&rdquo;
he cried turning away, &ldquo;all who wish to live to see the
accursed foreigners expelled forever from Greece, follow
me to the protection of the &lsquo;wooden wall!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;And all who are brave enough to defend their
city,&rdquo; cried the old man, still firm in his conviction,
&ldquo;follow me to the protection of the &lsquo;wooden wall!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a division of opinion at the last moment,
Themistocles winning nearly half of Kyrsilus&rsquo;
former followers.</p>
<p>Clinging tightly to Kyrsilus&rsquo; hand as they ascended
the steps of the Acropolis was a young girl possessing
exceptional charm of face and of personality.
The usual clearness of her blue eyes was dimmed with
tears, and the customary curve of her smiling lips had
vanished. Upon her luxuriant brown hair the sun revealed
gleams of gold. She was clad in a white garment
which hung in graceful folds from her shoulders.
Over this was slipped a <i>kolpos</i> plaited at the waist.
Her neck and arms were bare except for a necklace and
bracelets of silver. The white of her dress and ornaments
brought out in favorable contrast the healthful
pink of her youthful face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Kyrsilus,&rdquo; the girl was saying, &ldquo;I shall
think of you as my father while my own dear father is
preparing to fight the Persians in the bay. He fought
bravely at Marathon and I do not believe the gods will
see him defeated at Salamis. My uncle too is in command
of one of the ships!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is possible that with such brave men as we possess
on our side the victory will be ours,&rdquo; said the
elder, &ldquo;but remember the words of the oracle at Delphi!
Although there have been some differences of
opinion as to the meaning of the words of the oracle,
to me it is quite clear that our city should be defended
from its sacred hill. I am not criticizing your father,
nor Themistocles, nor others like them who seem
sincere in their belief that our land will be saved by a
battle upon the water. However your father left you in
my care, and I shall do what I deem best for your
safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A faint smile flitted across the girl&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Did it
ever occur to you, Kyrsilus, that the words of the Delphic
oracle are usually vague and ambiguous? Come,
be frank, do we not all try to interpret its prophecies
to our individual satisfactions? Take for instance
Themistocles, whose one obsession ever since he has
risen to a place of prominence, has been to increase our
navy. It is natural that he should desire to bring his
beloved navy into use at the first possible opportunity.
Then again let us consider you, dear Kyrsilus, and I
mean no offense whatever. Your sister served many
years as a priestess of Athena, performing her duties
with others in the temple of Athena on this Acropolis.
Then too you have lived in Athens longer than has
Themistocles. The city itself and above all its templed
hill, the very nucleus of Athens, are dearer to you than
relatives of whom you now have none surviving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man looked sadly at the girl and turned
his face away to hide a tear. He was deeply affected
by her words and the sincerity of her manner, but he
did not wish to betray his emotions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>With an effort at severity he said, &ldquo;My daughter
you do unwisely to ridicule the divine oracle of Apollo.
The words it utters are not as you say ambiguous, but
so fraught with significance that we mortals are incapable
of full comprehension. We do our best to interpret
the will of the god through his agents, and perhaps
at best we can only guess what revelations he
makes concerning the future. But it is unseemly in a
maiden of your years to criticize our divine source of
revelation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were now at the top of a long flight of broad
steps, and stood one hundred and fifty feet above the
level of the city. In the distance through an atmosphere
of unusual clarity they beheld to the south and
east, isolated peaks which, though apparently devoid
of vegetation, possessed a beauty of color and contour
that was enchanting. It was the time of the year when
the Etesian winds came from across the blue Aegean
and the whole fair land of Greece smiled under the
magic touch of the goddess, Demeter.</p>
<p>The faithful band of Kyrsilus&rsquo; followers passed
through the gateway of the Pelasgic wall and stood
in front of a large rectangular building, the temple of
Athene Polias<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>. Upon a pediment of this temple was
a grotesque serpent in relief, painted and gilded to a
dazzling brightness. Processions of priests and priestesses
with conventional head-dress and stereotyped
smile, formed a frieze which adorned the entablature.
A figure in relief of Theseus carrying across his shoulders
the Marathonian bull aroused in these, his supposed
descendents, a renewed courage to protect their
threatened city. They made ready for use what few
weapons of defense they had among them, then retired
to the temple to pray for the safety of Athens.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;My daughter,&rdquo; said old Kyrsilus, &ldquo;pray to Ares
that our soldiers may be possessed of unusual valor
and courage in the coming conflict, and pray to Athena
that our generals may wisely direct the approaching
battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father Kyrsilus,&rdquo; replied the maiden, &ldquo;I always
pray to one God! You may call Him Zeus if you wish,
but He is all powerful and in His hands alone rests
the fate of Greece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush my child,&rdquo; said the aged one, horrified,
&ldquo;you will call down the wrath of the goddess in whose
temple you now stand! Will you not pray to Athena?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the girl could reply, a young cripple, who
because of his affliction, had been unable to join his
friends in the defense of his land, hobbled into the
temple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are coming, they are coming!&rdquo; he cried
pointing with trembling finger to the west. The refugees,
looking in the direction indicated, beheld on the
distant horizon a mass of purplish nimbus which as it
gathered momentum gradually took the definite shape
of a vast glittering array of horsemen and foot-soldiers.
Petrified with terror they stood watching the
approaching multitude, which swept relentlessly toward
them, a great human deluge!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;Quick! gather rocks and stones and pile them
near the wall. The ascent is steep and few can attempt
to scale it at a time. We can easily hold them back
from the steps with these stones till our soldiers at
Salamis return to our aid.&rdquo; Kyrsilus forced an air
of bravado to encourage his countrymen, but his heart
sank as he beheld the barbarian host! For a brief
space the maid&rsquo;s doubt as to the wisdom of the oracle
also took possession of him, but only for a moment.
He thought, &ldquo;When all else fails, Athena will protect
her sanctuary and we can find refuge there.&rdquo; Soon
the oscillating wave of humanity was beneath them.
A voice from below rang out clearly above the clash
of weapons:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I represent, O Athenians, one of the banished
Peisistradi from this fair city. I beg of you, surrender
your city to this world conqueror and save your holy
places from pillage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the resolute voice of Kyrsilus that replied;
&ldquo;Behind the &lsquo;wooden wall&rsquo; will we defend our temples,
and the gods of Greece will aid us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer seemed to amaze the Persians. Their
officers drew aside and discussed the situation, arriving
at their decision without unanimity.</p>
<p>The cripple whose name was Philinus, was appointed
sentinel since he was unable to lift the heavy
rocks and stones. From a seat upon several boulders
near the wall he could observe the movements of the
Persians without being seen.</p>
<p>Many of the girls and women wept and prayed for
themselves and for their fathers, brothers, husbands
and sons now on the fleet. A few had lost loved ones
at Thermopyl&aelig;. The maiden who had been with
Kyrsilus showed remarkable self-control. To her the
others now turned for strength and encouragement.
One girl to whom she seemed especially dear, clung to
her robe tenaciously.</p>
<p>Kyrsilus approached his charge, and there was on
his countenance an expression of mingled horror and
compassion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;Persephone,&rdquo; he said with trembling accents,
&ldquo;if a worse fate than death threatens you, and you
can avail yourself of no weapon, better far fling yourself
to the rocks below!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl, Ladice, who clung tightly to Persephone&rsquo;s
hand wept bitterly, calling upon the names of all the
gods and goddesses to protect her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you so calm, Persephone?&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;Do you not realize that this Acropolis may be our
huge funeral pyre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes I know that, Ladice, but I pray to one God,
and I have a belief in a future existence beyond this
one, so I am not afraid to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I too have not had the horror of death that is
common to many, but not because of any thought of an
existence continuing beyond this. The certainty of
oblivion after a tumultuous life in this world of ours
is reward enough for me. Surely the peace of nonexistence
would be sufficient compensation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The smile on Persephone&rsquo;s face was indicative of
an inner knowledge out of which she derived supreme
satisfaction and which was incomprehensible to Ladice.</p>
<p>An elderly man by the name of Moschion called
excitedly from the gateway: &ldquo;It will be necessary for
all the women and girls who can, to help throw these
stones upon the Persians who are climbing faster than
we can prevent.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Persephone and Ladice with others rushed to their
task, rendering the needed assistance, though their
fingers bled and their bodies, unused to such prolonged,
strenuous labor, ached to the point of complete exhaustion.
The additional help from the women turned
the tide of fortune temporarily in their favor, and the
Persians were forced to abandon their attack upon
the well protected west side, but now they employed
different tactics! They poured upon the wooden
ramparts, arrows with burning tow attached to them
and it was not long before the palisades were consigned
to flames. Still the little group held its ground bravely,
but Kyrsilus and Moschion at last sent the women into
the temples where they soon joined them. Once within
the sanctuary of the city&rsquo;s patron goddess the frightened
Greeks looked for a miracle, and indeed nothing
short of a miracle could save them now! In this they
were doomed to disappointment for the temple to
Athena was the first to be reached by the hungry flames,
and the frenzied Greeks were forced to abandon it for
other smaller temples.</p>
<p>It was soon observed that Philinus was not with
them. He had last been seen in prayer before the altar
of Athena and doubtless there he had met his death! In
unspoken terror all wondered who would be the next
victim on the altar of oriental voracity. The chapel
of Aglaurus was farthest from the flames and to it the
terror-stricken Greeks fled. Here for a time at least
was safety and possible salvation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch the north side now!&rdquo; cried Kyrsilus,
&ldquo;The Persians may&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; but the words froze on his
lips, for there at the doorway stood fifteen or more of
the besiegers, who had succeeded in scaling the precipitous
northern side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the rocks below, my daughter!&rdquo; screamed
Kyrsilus. &ldquo;Do not forget my warning!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>An officer laid rough hands on the aged Moschion:
&ldquo;Old bald head, your time on earth is about up, anyway.
You may as well journey on without delay. Old
Charon is waiting to ferry you across the Styx.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; cried another voice, &ldquo;I prefer to die first
and not witness the end of these my followers.&rdquo; It was
Kyrsilus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you wish,&rdquo; cried the big Persian, &ldquo;you are
all to go anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brave Kyrsilus knelt before his captor whose
spear-head disappeared in his breast. His face was
convulsed in the agony of death, but with his last faint
breath he tried to speak to Persephone. &ldquo;Perhaps you
were right&mdash;about the oracle&mdash;to the rocks&mdash;below&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately following the tragic death of the
leader the remaining men were killed and the rough
floor of the little chapel became slippery with blood. A
number of the women, following old Kyrsilus&rsquo; advice,
flung themselves to certain death upon the ground below
rather than fall into the hands of Xerxes&rsquo; soldiers.</p>
<p>It was Artabazus, one of the most insolent and
rapacious of the king&rsquo;s officers, who discovered Persephone
and Ladice cowering in a remote corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho, look what I have found here!&rdquo; he laughed
in a coarse loud voice. &ldquo;Surely such a prize was
worth that perilous climb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took a step forward and seized Persephone
roughly, but as he did so, he caught the eye of a young
officer who had just arrived upon the scene together
with Xerxes himself. The king took in the situation at
a glance and his narrow eyes gleamed in approbation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A brave soldier deserves a fair prize, Artabazus,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;One moment please!&rdquo; It was the voice of the
young officer Zopyrus. &ldquo;Did you not, cousin Xerxes,
promise me a choice of the fairest maidens of the kingdom?
This land of Greece is now a part of your
kingdom, O mighty conqueror, and out of it I choose the
maiden whom Artabazus now holds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all one with me,&rdquo; cried the impatient monarch,
&ldquo;Artabazus shall have the other maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zopyrus stepped forward and took the half unconscious
form of the beautiful girl in his arms, and
amid the coarse jests and ribaldry of the Persian soldiery,
fled with his burden to the city below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IV.</span>

<p class="t0">&ldquo;First from the Greeks a tuneful shout uprose,</p>

<p class="lr">Aeschylus.</p>
</div>
<p>The Persian forces were now turning from the
Acropolis, and drunk with victory, were scattering
over the city. Dwellings were plundered
and burned, and a few wild-eyed Greeks who had remained
to guard their valuable possessions, fled in mad
confusion, but were overtaken by the ruthless enemy
and slaughtered.</p>
<p>Zopyrus&rsquo; one desire was to leave behind him the
horrors of massacre and conflagration. With great
difficulty he forced his way through jostling crowds of
demoniac soldiers, who upon recognition of his uniform
and insignia, stayed their impulse which was to murder
any who did not take part with them in the destruction
of the city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>The heat of a noon-day sun shone upon a scene
unparalleled in the gruesome aspect which it presented.
Zopyrus turned his face to the west, for in this direction
the Persians did not go. Their fiendish work was
in the heart of the once glorious city which lay to the
north and east. Many too were pursuing a south-west
course in the direction of the bay of Phalerum where
the Persian navy had its headquarters.</p>
<p>As Zopyrus trudged onward, the limp form of the
Greek girl in his arms, he noticed that the road which
he had chosen, though now deserted, was of unusual
width and well paved. The dazzling heat, reflected
from the white pavement, became oppressive, and it
was with a feeling of ineffable joy that he saw to the
right the cool green shadows of an olive-grove. Looking
back between the gnarled trunks of two large trees
whose branches were entwined in serpentine fashion,
he beheld the Acropolis topped with its smoldering
ruins. Once within the cool recesses of the grove he
deposited his burden, and as he did so, he received a
shock. Where before had he beheld those identical
features in the relaxation of death? He looked again
intently, thinking it an hallucination, and while his gaze
rested upon her face, the maiden opened her eyes.
With a look of unspeakable horror she recoiled, then
as quickly turned her face in his direction, her features
expressing amazement. The refinement of his countenance
in combination with his Persian uniform astonished
her greatly. She marveled at his attitude of
reserve. His gaze met hers and held it with an impelling
magnetism till she dropped her eyes in confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;are a Greek in disguise?&rdquo; she faltered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, I am a Persian officer in the
army of Xerxes,&rdquo; he replied, and perceiving her look
of terror, he added, &ldquo;but I will not harm you, rather
I have rescued you from a horrible fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am truly grateful, but I am puzzled as to
why you should care to do that for me, a daughter of
the enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The motives of a Persian are not always altogether
base,&rdquo; he replied somewhat coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand pardons,&rdquo; she beseeched, &ldquo;I am
greatly indebted to you for your kindness, but my people
have suffered horribly at the hands of yours, and
surely you can not wonder at my attitude!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied more gently, &ldquo;I do not blame
you, but I am glad to prove to you that Ahura-Mazd&acirc;o
may be as deserving of worship as Zeus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To his surprise the suspicion of a smile flitted
across her face. Was this bewitching Athenian maiden
mocking him? Her features were again serious as she
said: &ldquo;Ahura-Mazd&acirc;o and Zeus are one. There is one
all-powerful God, and compared with Him the others
are quite insignificant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believe that?&rdquo; he asked with fresh interest.
&ldquo;I had supposed polytheism to be the unshaken belief
of the Greeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the majority that is true,&rdquo; she replied seriously,
&ldquo;but many of us, while performing the rites due
our gods and goddesses, send our prayers to a Deity
who is above the petty jealousies of the gods of Olympus.
It was a prayer to that Deity which saved me
from a tragic fate on the Acropolis!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>He looked at her with a new interest. Not only
did he consider her very beautiful, but he was surprised
to find her possessing more intellect than was usual
among the Persian girls of his acquaintance. He knew
too, that the Greek women were educated to be principally
home-makers, and that beyond the duties of
wives and mothers, their training was somewhat deficient.
Therefore he was not a little amazed that this
maid of Athens could express her views on religion
with the assurance of a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a prayer to the Deity saved you, can not another
such prayer save your ships there at Salamis?&rdquo;
he asked, but so kindly that she did not resent his question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go to the shore,&rdquo; she cried eagerly, &ldquo;and
there I shall pray that success may come to my poor
fellow-countrymen who know that their beloved city
lies in ashes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they ascended the ravine which intersects the
range of Mt. Aegaleos and gazed beyond toward the
low hills which lay like purple velvet, fold on fold, it
seemed to the man and the maid that hatred and warfare
must be altogether odious to a God who had created
such beauty. And it seemed to them that man, the
crown of his creation, was not fashioned for the murder
of his fellows, or to perish on the bloody field of battle.
They passed numerous sanctuaries and temples whose
white pillars stood like silent ghosts hiding amid the
dark foliage of shady groves, or half concealed behind
some grassy hillock, but always the great vault of the
universal temple impressed upon them their common
beliefs. At length from the top of a woody eminence
they beheld the silvery sheet of the bay of Salamis,
dotted with the Greek triremes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let us take this wooded path to the south,&rdquo;
suggested Zopyrus. &ldquo;It will take us to the shore at a
point considerably north of the Persian forces and out
of the danger of meeting any chance pedestrians to
Eleusis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Persephone had explained that the road which
they had traveled up to this point was indeed the
Sacred Way which led from Athens to the city of
Eleusis where there was a temple dedicated to the worship
of Demeter and of Dionysus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many of my friends are now on yonder island,&rdquo;
said Persephone pointing in the direction of the mountains
of Salamis which girdled the bay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why were you not with them in this time of peril
to your city?&rdquo; asked the Persian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because my father, who is out there with the
Greek fleet, left me in the care of an old friend,
Kyrsilus, who believed that Athens could be saved by
defending the Acropolis. My father will be frantic
with grief when he hears of the fate of Athens, for he
lost a son, my twin brother, in the battle of Thermopyl&aelig;.
My brother Phales, was considered too young
to fight and was refused permission to join the naval
forces when he applied to Eurybiades, the commander
of our fleet, so he united with the Spartans under king
Leonidas, and as you know, not one of the three-hundred
soldiers escaped death.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>Zopyrus was too overcome with emotion to trust
himself to speak. Like a flash the association of her
lovely face as she lay passive in his arms, with that
other face, so strangely similar, was made clear. His
had been the hand that had laid low that youth just
on the threshold of manhood, and caused sorrow to the
brave father and the devoted sister! In his mind he
lived over again that period of mental anguish preceding
the battle of Thermopyl&aelig;. Then once again as in
the heat of battle he saw before him the handsome face
of the Greek lad as he lay at his feet in the peace of
death. Oh, it was unbearable! He passed his hand
across his eyes as if to shut out the haunting vision
and lo! as he drew his hand away the same face was
before him still, only now it appeared in the fresh
vigor of life! As they followed the course of the little
by-path, she noticed his sudden silence and wondered if
it were possible that he felt any sorrow that a Greek
soldier, though her brother, had met death in the pass
of Thermopyl&aelig;.</p>
<p>No more words passed between them until they
stood side by side on a small promontory, the bay,
reflecting the glory of an afternoon sun at their feet.
Persephone stood shading her eyes and looking eagerly
toward the Greek triremes as if she hoped even at that
distance to be able to discern a familiar figure on board.
It was with new emotions that Zopyrus watched the
slender form of the girl silhouetted against a horizon
of water and sky like a sylph limned on gauze. She
was clad in the flowing white, sleeveless <i>chiton</i> of the
women of higher caste, with a plaited <i>kolpos</i>, giving a
puff effect at the waist. Her hair, gold where the sun
shone upon it but brown in the shadows, was parted
so that it fell in loose waves around her temples. At
the back, low in her neck, it was gathered in a soft
Psyche knot. Her nose was typically Greek, straight
and thin, and the perfect contour of cheek and chin
was the same that Zopyrus had observed in the slain
lad at Thermopyl&aelig;.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just so have the opposing fleets lain for days,&rdquo;
she cried. &ldquo;That is the position in which they were
when news was received at Athens that Aristides had
arrived from Aegina whither he had been banished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think the Greek fleet would do well to
strike first? Why not wait for the Persians to take
the initiative?&rdquo; Zopyrus asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I will tell you, a Persian, what I
think?&rdquo; she cried angrily.</p>
<p>He thought she was going to leave him, but in that
he was mistaken. She walked a few paces away still
gazing with shaded eyes toward the triremes. Her
features now showed the tragic expression of despair.
Themistocles had told the Athenians that the Peloponnesians
might withdraw their ships, and this, Persephone
knew would mean victory to the Persians, and
Asiatic rule in Greece. Why, oh why did the Greek
ships hold back! It was in an agony of despair that
the girl sank to her knees and would have fallen had
Zopyrus not run to her assistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prayer, oh, I had nearly forgotten the prayer
for my people! I said I would pray at the shore and
so I shall, for the salvation of Greece and the expulsion
of the enemy!&rdquo; The tears were coursing down her
rounded cheeks and her frame shook with sobs. Reverently
she raised her eyes to heaven and prayed with
greater fervor than she had on the Acropolis. Then
a few lives had been at stake, now the future of a nation
and possibly races of mankind were involved!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>The sun apparently crept a few feet nearer its goal
and still the girl remained in her attitude of supplication.
All at once she stood erect and turned amazed
in the direction of Eleusis and the Sacred Way. Borne
on the breeze that was wafted across the picturesque
bay of Eleusis came the sound of myriads of voices
raised in a mighty p&aelig;an of joy. The chant rose and
fell in awful grandeur striking fear and adoring wonder
to the hearts of Persians and Greeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the Hymn to Dionysus!&rdquo; cried Persephone.
&ldquo;That is the way it sounds at festival times, only this
is a thousand times grander. There are none left in
Greece to sing that hymn! Do you not see it is a
miracle sent by the Deity in answer to my prayer?
Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The volume of sound grew louder and more distinct
until it seemed to surround them and they stood dumb
with astonishment. Out over the waters of Salamis
drifted the p&aelig;an of solemn, dignified joy, and into the
heart of every Greek it sent its message. Never to
hear again in reality the Hymn to Dionysus! Never to
walk in joyous procession with the celebrants from
Athens to Eleusis, bearing the statue of Iocchos! Never
to celebrate the national festivals so dear to the heart
of every Greek! Was Greece to be overrun and conquered
by Orientals? The p&aelig;an died away gradually
and was followed by an ominous, death-like silence.
Then a very different sound pierced the ears of the
two listeners. It was the battle-cry of the Greeks as
they sent forth their ships to meet the enemy. All fear
had fled. Only one motive actuated the entire fleet and
that was to save Greece at any cost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see the ship that leads the assault?&rdquo;
cried Persephone excitedly. &ldquo;That is commanded by
Lycomedes, a brave captain well deserving of the honors
he has won in previous conflicts, but the ship behind
is a close second.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The leading Greek ship pursued a Persian vessel
which was seemingly but a few feet in advance of the
Greek boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Persian vessel is making for that narrow
space yonder but I doubt if it will have room to turn
about and face its antagonist. It is like sailing between
Scylla and Charybdis,&rdquo; said Zopyrus. &ldquo;Look it is
about to turn, but the space will not permit. There&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke the boat commanded by Lycomedes
struck that of the Persian broadside, nearly cutting it
in twain with the sharp, strong beak. Instantly the
greatest confusion reigned on board the damaged vessel.
Soldiers leapt into the water, preferring drowning
to death or captivity at the hands of the enemy. Persephone
turned away with a shudder. Zopyrus observed
her narrowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It pains you to witness the victory of this Lycomedes?&rdquo;
he asked with a touch of sarcasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she replied in distressed tones, &ldquo;I
should have been glad to hear of it, but I can not enjoy
being an eye-witness to such a terrible scene!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His feeling of bitterness left and he said more
kindly, &ldquo;Will you not go and rest under the shade of
some tree well out of sight and somewhat out of sound
of this battle?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Her reply rather surprised him. &ldquo;If you can
watch so serenely the annihilation of your countrymen,
I can endure witnessing the victory of mine. Oh,&rdquo; here
she unconsciously clutched Zopyrus&rsquo; arm, unaware of
the thrill of contact to the Persian, &ldquo;the second ship
is commanded by my brave uncle, Ameinias. Look, he
is pursuing a Persian ship which has so far eluded his
beak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The battle was now raging in earnest, Persephone
and Zopyrus stood with tense interest while at their
feet was enacted one of the world&rsquo;s great tragic
dramas. The narrow space in which they were engaged
hindered the Persians and rendered their superior
number a disadvantage. Becoming panic-stricken,
they collided with each other. Oars were broken, and
unable to steer, they could not direct their blows with
the prows, by which means they sought to sink an
enemy ship. The bay was a moving mass of driving
beaks and heaving wreckage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose is the vessel that my uncle still pursues?&rdquo;
asked the girl presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the ship of Artemisia, queen of Halicarnassus,&rdquo;
he replied.</p>
<p>No sooner had the words fallen from his lips than
the Karian queen&rsquo;s boat collided with that of one of
her countrymen, and Ameinias abandoned the pursuit.
But Artemisia&rsquo;s boat was not damaged and retreated
quickly to the Persian side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe the collision was deliberate,&rdquo; said
Zopyrus more to himself than to his companion. &ldquo;By
apparently becoming a deserter and sinking one of her
own ships, she escaped with her life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this Artemisia, that she commands a ship
and displays such keen intelligence in naval warfare?&rdquo;
asked Persephone with growing interest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;She is a companion of Xerxes, and had proven
a wise counsellor. Her advice when followed has always
been adept, and when unheeded, disaster has
resulted. This naval engagement with the Greeks was
undertaken entirely against her wishes and this is the
result!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Persephone smiled. &ldquo;I am glad I do not have to
serve in the capacity of king&rsquo;s counsellor. My talents
evidently lie in a different direction. I can not cause
battles to be fought or not, at will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, little maid of Greece, but it seems that by
your prayers you can determine the results of the
battles that <i>are</i> fought. Your power is far greater
than that of Artemisia!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes were filled with tears of happiness. &ldquo;The
One God who is powerful above all others <i>does</i> hear
and answer the prayers of earnest suppliants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was difficult to say whether the sweet loveliness
in the lines of Persephone&rsquo;s face, or her majesty
of character gave her the greater fascination, but as
the youth gazed upon her features illuminated with
triumph and joy, he became convinced that she was
the most attractive woman he had ever known.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the battle is over, where will you go?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherever my father or uncle wish,&mdash;and you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment he hesitated. Should he tell her of
his Greek mother and of the conflicting emotions which
had been his ever since the beginning of the campaign?
She observed his indecision and said softly even seductively:
&ldquo;You have seen much to rouse your sympathy
for my people, have you not? Surely the atrocities
wrought by the Persians have not met with the
approval of one who could rescue a maiden in dire distress,
though she were of the enemy!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Zopyrus was soldier before he was lover. He had
come over with the Persian host to aid in subduing
Greece, and here he was nearly allowing himself to be
swayed by the charms of a Greek maid. For the moment
he forgot that his Greek mother had been the
strongest influence, barring his vows as an officer, that
had as yet actuated him in this campaign. He felt
momentarily the sting of the defeat of Salamis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go to the Persians at Phalerum, after I have
seen you safe with your people,&rdquo; he replied coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no danger now,&rdquo; she answered, and
there was a twinkle in her eye. &ldquo;With the defeat of
the Persians, I am secure in my own country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her speechlessly as she stood in an
attitude of superb defiance, then moved by a sudden
impulse, he strode toward her and gathered her roughly
in his arms, crushing her against him till she cried out
with pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see your danger is not over, is it?&rdquo; he asked
fiercely.</p>
<p>She ceased to struggle, and when he looked at her
pale face and into her eyes, which are ever truer messengers
of the soul than the spoken words of the mouth,
he read a truth which bewildered him. Passionately
he kissed her lips, once, twice, thrice, then rudely put
her from him and strode away in the direction of
Phalerum.</p>

</div>
<p>A small barge shot out from the shadows of a
cliff through the light spray which spumed about
its prow as it cut the billows. Its occupants, in
addition to the two oarsmen, were a youth and maiden
of comely features. The former was clad in a long,
deep bordered <i>chiton</i> covered with a <i>chlamys</i> or cape
of semi-military style. His feet were protected by
leather sandals, bound with straps about the calves of
his legs. In indolent ease he stretched his too graceful
form and gazed from beneath half closed eye-lids at
the beautiful young woman who reclined upon a cushioned
dais at the boat&rsquo;s prow. The woman, if she were
conscious of the other&rsquo;s gaze, did not make it manifest.
Her eyes sought the tranquil water with a dreamy, faraway
expression. For some time the two sat thus. At
length the man&rsquo;s attitude of indolence changed abruptly.
He leaned forward, drawing his companion&rsquo;s
gaze to his.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why this coolness to me, Persephone? You have
been a changed girl ever since I found you wandering
alone on the shore near Eleusis. Have the horrors of
recent events affected your reason, that you do not
smile upon me as was your wont?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be the war, Ephialtes, that makes my
spirit so downcast. If only the entire Persian army
had retreated across the Hellespont with Xerxes!
Hordes of them still remain in Thessaly, rallying, I
presume, to attack us again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are safe here at Salamis for the time being,
and if I thought what you have said was the true cause
of your listlessness, I should not worry, but I have
feared lately that you consider seriously the attentions
of Icetes, may Pluto take him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Persephone colored to her temples at these words.
&ldquo;Icetes is a sincere and lovable friend. He is no more
to me than an elder brother and I will not hear his
name so defiled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sneer curled the handsome lips of the Greek but
his expression changed quickly to one of passionate
adoration. &ldquo;I have loved you ever since I first saw
you, Persephone, and I will not allow another to come
between you, the rare object of my affections and me.
Your father has consented to a betrothal, has he not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maiden looked away quickly. &ldquo;Father does
not wholly approve of you, Ephialtes, if the truth must
be known. You know father has strict ideas and I am
his only daughter!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you are,&rdquo; the young man responded
irritably, &ldquo;but he must expect you to wed sometime,
and where will he find a better suitor for your hand outside
of royalty? I have wealth,&rdquo; here Ephialtes
touched the rich border of his costly garment and the
jewel in his dark hair, &ldquo;good looks, and prospects of
political favor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Persephone hesitated to state that the doubtful
source of Ephialtes&rsquo; wealth was one of her father&rsquo;s
objections to him as a prospective son-in-law. Also
the fact that he spent his money lavishly upon personal
comforts and luxuries, but had failed to donate toward
the sum being raised for the rebuilding of Athens, was
against him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not press me for an answer now, Ephialtes.
The Persians have not yet been expelled from Greece,
and you may have to don helmet and cuirass once again
before our beloved country is safe from the oriental
invader.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the Athenians return to rebuild Athens
will you give me your answer?&rdquo; persisted Ephialtes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will consider seriously at that time,&rdquo; replied
the girl smiling demurely into the handsome face now
close to her own.</p>
<p>Persephone was a true Greek in that she believed
that physical beauty was the index of the rarer qualities
of mind and heart. The youth who sat opposite
possessed physical beauty to an unusual degree. The
soft breezes from across the water stirred his dark
thick locks, and the dazzling reflection of the late afternoon
sun on the dancing waves was reflected a second
time from his dark eyes whose light fluctuated even as
that upon the oscillating surface of the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me again of your heroism at Thermopyl&aelig;,&rdquo;
whispered the maiden.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I would not seem to brag of my gift of valor.
It is enough, is it not, that I have told you of my attempt
to save the life of Leonidas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Persephone smiled at him in approval, then her
features became serious as she asked: &ldquo;Has the traitor
of Thermopyl&aelig; yet been discovered? But for him, our
city would not now be in ashes and thousands of lives
would have been spared including that of my dear
brother, Phales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She raised tear-dimmed eyes to her companion:
&ldquo;Ephialtes, seek the traitor and deliver him to us, that
through the agency of man, God may avenge that foul
act of treason. Could you do this, Greece would honor
your name as it did that of Miltiades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man turned his face away, his mood quickly
altered by the girl&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humanity is fickle,&rdquo; he replied with a peculiar
air of detachment. &ldquo;Miltiades did not enjoy public
favor for long, you remember. Just because he went
on a little trip to avenge a personal wrong, immediately
the populace forgot his heroism at Marathon and convicted
him for that minor offence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; replied the girl, &ldquo;Miltiades became arrogant
and forgot public interests for his own. Zeus
always punishes insolence by having Justice recompense
in due season.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Ephialtes was obstinately silent, unmoved by Persephone&rsquo;s
words. He dared say no more for fear of
betraying himself. Persephone, he loved to as great
an extent as it is possible for one of such selfish instincts
to love. She did not possess great wealth, and
conscious of his own mercenary nature, he wondered
that he could so love where money was no object. He
had great respect for her mental superiority, while at
the same time he feared it, but it was her physical
loveliness which appealed to him most. He longed
to possess her, body and soul, and the usual patience
with which he could await the attainment of his desires,
was becoming depleted. He had always prided himself
on his ability to bridle his impulses if he felt that they
interfered in any way with the ultimate attainment
of a desired goal. Where self-restraint is lacking,
there is no order, and no one knew this any better than
Ephialtes.</p>
<p>It was that magical hour between daylight and
dusk that is of such short duration in the countries of
the south. Away to the west stretched the hills of
Salamis, the setting sun shedding a flood of glory upon
the picturesque undulations. Then one by one the
stars began to appear and soon the canopy of the
heavens was studded with myriads of twinkling lights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us hasten back to the island,&rdquo; said Persephone
shivering slightly. &ldquo;The air is chill and I
brought no wrap with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man removed his cape and placed it
around the shoulders of his companion. Persephone
seemed despondent. Even the beauty of the evening
on the water beneath the stars did not cheer her. The
barge was now, at the request of the maiden, turning
its prow toward the promontories of her temporary
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Persephone,&rdquo; pleaded the youth once more, &ldquo;will
you not give me an answer now, and if in the affirmative,
I shall be the happiest man in all Greece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Persephone smiled a little, but was still troubled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Ephialtes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you have it in you
to be so brave as you proved at Thermopyl&aelig;, but before
I consent to a marriage between us, I want one more
accomplishment that will bring glory to your name.
Discover for our country Thermopyl&aelig;&rsquo;s traitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ephialtes&rsquo; brow clouded. &ldquo;That is a very difficult
task. Will not proof of heroic valor in the next conflict
with the Persians suffice to bring you to my arms,
a willing bride?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The barge now glided into a cove near the city,
and Ephialtes rose to assist his fair companion in
alighting from her seat at the prow. As she yielded
her arm to his, she raised to his face a countenance,
though outwardly serene, yet strangely determined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the day that you deliver to Greece the traitor
of Thermopyl&aelig; I will become your wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="lr">Nicholas Michell.</p>
</div>
<p>At the top of the long rugged path by which
one mounted the Acropolis, stood a young man
of martial bearing. Upon his features contempt
and yearning curiously mingled. At his feet lay a
city now silent and deserted, which had once teemed
with active humanity. Whether he looked to north or
south, to east or west, there crowded upon his memory
in rapid succession, incidents that brought to him the
convincing reality that this city was associated with all
that was dear to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>The fleeting memories that crowded in and out of
his mind came from a diversity of experiences. Now
there came to him thoughts as he looked toward the
Agora<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> that brought a wistful smile to his lips. He
was once more a mischievous boy running through the
busy market to escape the wrath of the pursuing vender
whom he had angered by the theft of a tempting
bit of fruit. Then&mdash;and his brow clouded while a blush
of shame flushed his cheek&mdash;he was a wild youth arrogant
and proud, and steeped in sin, how deep, he did
not realize till later! Then had followed the excitement
of war&mdash;his father as commander of the Greeks
had won a great victory over the Persians at Marathon!
His father the great Miltiades, whose name was
on every tongue and whose praise was sung throughout
Greece, returned, the idol of the hour, and Cimon,
though too young to have participated at Marathon,
commemorated his parent&rsquo;s triumph with a sumptuous
feast, the like of which had never before nor since been
celebrated in Athens. And then&mdash;here Cimon&rsquo;s head
sank upon his breast&mdash;had followed the disgrace and
death of that father whose bravery had been extoled
throughout the land. His courageous father who had
stood firm before the darts of Datis and Artaphernes,
yielded to a desire to avenge a petty, personal wrong,
and fell with an arrow in his heart. But after all,
Cimon considered, had not the father&rsquo;s disgrace
brought the son to his senses? His former friends
shunned him in a way that he knew was due not alone
to the paternal disgrace, but to the former arrogance
with which he had flaunted his pride of social standing
in the faces of his associates.</p>
<p>The blush of shame which mantled his brow gave
evidence of the remorse which the young Cimon had
suffered. Suddenly he stood erect and held his head
high, a triumphant gleam in his blue eyes. Yes he had
made a real man of himself after all and had won the
respect and confidence of his fellows, not through his
poor father&rsquo;s achievements, but through virtues of his
own. He would do what he could yet to bring this beloved
city back to her former splendor. The Persians
though defeated at Salamis, would he knew, rally for
another attack, for they had not left northern Greece,
and he, Cimon, would exert himself to the utmost to
save the land which his father had so bravely defended
ten years before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>His eyes glowed with enthusiasm while visions of
the future held him in absorption. What Miltiades had
been to Greece, he would be, and <i>more</i>. His father had
been all soldier, but in him, Cimon, were there not
mingled some of the qualities necessary to the making
of a statesman as well? He turned and viewed with
grief the ponderous slabs that had once composed the
temple to Athena. Would not Athens soon need another
such edifice, grander and of more beautiful proportions
than the one which had recently occupied this
site? Some leader would arise after this war, why
not he? Of course Themistocles, here his brow puckered
to a frown, was a great man and had been the savior
of Greece at Salamis, but Themistocles would soon be
past his prime, whereas <i>he</i> was young. He drew himself
to his full height, unconsciously placed his hand
upon the hilt of his sword and gazed beyond the north
horizon in which direction he knew the Persians rallied
for another attack upon the stronghold of Attica.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>His mind returned again to the statesman, Themistocles.
He had been the last person to see Ladice
alive, and it was known for certain that she was among
those who ascended the Acropolis with Kyrsilus. Although
it was first reported that all of that brave little
band had been slaughtered, rumor had been rife that
some of the younger women had been spared&mdash;but only
to meet a worse fate; that of captivity in the harems
of the Persians. If that had been Ladice&rsquo;s fate, far
better that she had met death with the others on the
Acropolis! But Ladice did not love him. Oh, the sting
of that realization! Ladice knew of the wild life that he
had led and of the drunken orgies in which he had participated.
Perhaps it was presumptuous for him to
think with love upon a girl of such stainless character
as Ladice, but had he not vowed by all the gods that he
would live an upright life and had he not kept that vow
for nearly four years?</p>
<p>Slowly he advanced among the ruins which lay
about him, mute evidences of a destructive power as
yet unconquered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She probably offered a last prayer to Athena
here,&rdquo; he surmised as he sadly surveyed what had
once been the sanctuary of that goddess. Vainly he
strove to suppress the violent agitation of his soul.
At last with a despairing cry he sank to his knees, and
with uplifted hands prayed to the goddess: &ldquo;Oh
Athena, thou who knowest what took place at thy
sanctuary, even though thou wert unable to defend it
against the hordes of Xerxes, did Ladice die among
the followers of Kyrsilus or was she taken captive by
Persian soldiers? If she is now a prisoner among
them, is there a chance for her rescue? Is there a
chance for this city that is named for thee O Athena?
Give me a sign, O Goddess, that is all I ask, a sign
that I may set forth with renewed hope and vigor to
aid in expelling the dreaded foes from our boundaries!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Cimon staggered to his feet, his eyes resting
wearily on the debris that was piled about him.
Presently among the fragments of a demolished pillar
he saw something that caused him to doubt the truthfulness
of his sight. Here on the top of the Acropolis
where destruction through the agency of fire and
sword had been followed by chaos, was a bit of living
green vegetation! Cimon approached in awe and bewilderment,
then he uttered an exclamation of joy,
for the sacred olive tree which had been planted in
honor of the patron goddess years before, had sent
forth a new green shoot a cubit in length. The young
man knew as he gazed upon this miracle of life sprung
from the ashes of death, that Athena spoke by the olive-branch
the promise that Athens should arise from her
despair and ruin. With a lighter heart than he had
felt for many a weary day, Cimon descended the path,
and in his heart not only hope, but a grim determination
to help in the restoration of his beloved city, found
lodgment.</p>

<p class="t0">&ldquo;How oft when men are at the point of death</p>
<p class="t0">Have they been merry!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="lr">Shakespeare.</p>
</div>
<p>After the defeat of the Persians at Salamis,
Xerxes retreated across the Hellespont to Asia,
but Mardonius was not so easily disheartened.
With three hundred thousand men he wintered in Thessaly
making thorough preparations for a second attack
upon Athens the following summer. What was his
utter amazement upon re-entering the city to find it
completely deserted, its citizens having remained at
Salamis, Troezen and Aegina. Thereupon he retreated
to Thebes in B&oelig;otia there to await the Greek offensive
which was to be strengthened by aid from the Spartans.</p>
<p>On a certain evening in spring, ten months after
the destruction of Athens, Zopyrus and his friend
Masistius, sat outside the entrance of the latter&rsquo;s tent
in the Persian encampment near Thebes. The night
was cool for that time of the year, but the chill was
warded off to some extent by a brightly blazing fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What think you of this sumptuous feast to be
given by the Theban Attaginus, on the morrow?&rdquo; asked
Zopyrus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;I expect I shall enjoy the feast, but I do not
admire the B&oelig;otians,&rdquo; replied Masistius. &ldquo;They are
unfaithful to their country&rsquo;s cause, and above all
things I loathe a traitor. Of course our outward appearances
must be those of friendship, for they are of
inestimable service to the Persian cause, but how different
from the traitorous Thebans was that little band
of Athenians who tried to defend their Acropolis!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zopyrus&rsquo; brow clouded at memory of that tragic
scene. &ldquo;By the way Masistius, what became of the
girl whom Xerxes gave to Artabazus when the latter
was forced to surrender the maiden to whom I laid
claim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Masistius gazed silently into the bright flames and
tossed a twig into the fire, watching it a moment before
he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her young life will be consumed just as that
twig. She was taken away by Artabazus and is now
a captive in his harem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Masistius paused a moment impressively, then he
asked without even glancing in Zopyrus&rsquo; direction:
&ldquo;And the other maiden, what of her? But that is a
rude question,&rdquo; he added, laying an affectionate hand
upon the other&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;I presume by now she is
safe with her people.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Zopyrus turned quickly and sought his companion&rsquo;s
gaze. &ldquo;Friend Masistius,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have
kept locked within my breast these ten months, a secret,
so precious that I hesitate to share it, and I would not
do so were it not approaching the eve of battle, but to
you who throughout this entire campaign, have been
the only friend whose ideas of life coincide with mine,
I will disclose that which I had not thought to reveal
to mortal man. Although my acquaintance with the
maiden of whom you speak was of short duration, it
was, nevertheless, long enough to convince me that I
want her for my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Persian cavalryman expressed no little surprise
at his friend&rsquo;s disclosure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was the infatuation mutual?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I possess any ability in interpreting a maiden&rsquo;s
thoughts through her eyes, my love is reciprocated,&rdquo;
said Zopyrus, the color mounting to his temples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that be the case,&rdquo; spoke Masistius heartily,
&ldquo;may Ahura-Mazd&acirc;o bring you together after we have
conquered Greece!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if we cannot succeed in subduing the
Greeks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Zeus may perform the act of reuniting
you,&rdquo; replied Masistius somewhat bitterly.</p>
<p>The fire had by this time died down till only a few
glowing embers remained. Zopyrus rose to take his
leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell, Masistius, till the feast. Forget the
confidences of the past hour. This love of mine can
avail nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of that I am not so sure, Zopyrus. The vision
of a certain beautiful young woman has kept up my
courage that might otherwise have failed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a friendly hand-clasp, the two parted.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>The hall appropriated to the feast was part of the
private home of the Theban leader, Attaginus. Through
a wide entrance at one side of the hall, the guests
glimpsed a court, the floor of which was of variegated
mosaic tiles forming intricate designs and patterns. In
the center a marble fountain tossed up its silvery cooling
spray. Among the potted palms and ferns, birds
of bright-colored plumage flitted about adding their
sweet notes to that of cithera and flute. Rarest flowers
of every hue glowed from sculptured vases among the
green foliage of the plants, and sweet spices burned in
guilded tripods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Within the hall the cedar-wood tables<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> groaned
under the weight of gold and silver dishes filled with
tasty viands. There were thrushes browned to a turn,
fish, lentils, olive-oil, cheese, fruit, cakes baked in the
shape of Persian and Greek soldiers, and many desserts
and dainties to induce thirst for the wine which
was to come later.</p>
<p>The astute Attaginus had arranged his guests in
such a manner that a B&oelig;otian and a Persian occupied
the same couch. In this way he hoped to stimulate the
fraternal spirit between Persian and Greek. Thus
Artabazus found himself occupying a couch with a
Theban cavalryman by the name of Timegenidas,
Masistius discovered his companion to be a certain
Theban, Asopodorus, while Mardonius and Attaginus
were partners.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Zopyrus being an inferior officer to those mentioned,
sat among others of equal rank with himself at
an end of the hall. In spite of the revel and festivity
about him, he labored in vain to throw off a sense of
depression. To one of his nature it was impossible
to forget the probable tragedies of the morrow in the
carousal and merry-making of today. These men
about him were trying to veil sorrow with levity; a
thing that men have done for countless ages and probably
always will; a last expiring effort to enjoy life
while it is still in their possession; a desire to crowd
out of consciousness the possibility of oblivion by a
present rapturous delight in the reality of existence.</p>
<p>The Greek who sat with Zopyrus observed his nonchalance
and endeavored to encourage conversation.
He plied Zopyrus with questions as to his native city,
the details of the campaign from Sardis to Thessaly,
until the Persian was forced to make similar inquiries
in regard to the B&oelig;otian, who he learned was a citizen
of Orchomenus, by the name of Thersander.</p>
<p>At the close of the above mentioned courses servants
entered and moved noiselessly about, putting
wreaths on the heads and around the necks of the guests
and pouring upon them sweet-scented ointments. At
this point in the feast Attaginus arose and all eyes were
turned in his direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will appoint a symposiarch<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> by lot,&rdquo; he explained,
&ldquo;so that Greek and Persian will be treated
fairly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe my companion here would make an excellent
symposiarch,&rdquo; said Timegenidas, laughingly
indicating Artabazus. &ldquo;I think he would be sparing
in the use of water. Am I right, my friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where wine, revelry and women, though the latter
are sadly wanting here, are concerned,&rdquo; said Artabazus
in a loud voice, &ldquo;there I am willing to take a
prominent part.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure you would prove an excellent symposiarch,&rdquo;
courteously replied the host, &ldquo;but we will tonight
follow the usual custom and cast lots for that
service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lot fell to Masistius before whom the servants
placed a large ornate mixing bowl upon a handsome
golden salver. In accordance with his practice of moderation
in all things, Masistius used three parts of
water to two of wine, much to the disgust of Artabazus
and a few others present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Masistius,&rdquo; called Artabazus, &ldquo;this may be the
last wine we drink here on earth, so beware of mixing
frog&rsquo;s wine. Make it strong enough for us to forget
in it the threatening dangers of tomorrow. Add some
more of that which our host says comes from Lesbos!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The symposiarch ignored the latter&rsquo;s remarks.
His large, well-built frame, as he performed his task,
attracted the attention of all the banqueters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he attains such superb physique with three
parts of water and two of wine, we can do no better
than to follow his example,&rdquo; said one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is said there is none braver among the men
of the cavalry,&rdquo; remarked another.</p>
<p>To all this conversation, Zopyrus was a silent
listener. His eyes rested with fond approval upon the
manly form of his friend Masistius. He watched
closely the frank, open countenance and was well
pleased with the jovial, but at the same time, dignified
demeanor. How would it fare with Masistius on the
morrow? Of himself he did not think. He was presently
aware that Artabazus was addressing the banqueters
generally.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;You Greeks actually do not seem to miss the presence
of women at your banquets! Now to me, for my
tastes are so refined, the presence of feminine beauty
adds a charm for which no amount of flowers, birds or
music can substitute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Greek Asopodorus now spoke, and his voice
in contrast to the raucous accents of the Persian, fell
pleasingly upon the ears of the feasters. &ldquo;We Greeks
believe in a unit of love in which love of beauty, of
wealth, sensual love, intellectual love and many others
are but earthly modifications of the true and the good.
Thus a love which satisfies the &aelig;sthetic can take as
great delight in the manly strength of a youth&rsquo;s body
as in the graceful, softer lines of a woman&rsquo;s form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; thought Zopyrus, &ldquo;Many of these Greeks
think and feel as Asopodorus. Their adoration of loveliness
in any form is their outstanding characteristic.
They love the beauty of this earthly paradise in which
they dwell, yet because they love power less, they are
turning over their beautiful land to foreigners. If I
had only been born a Greek!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced at Thersander. &ldquo;I am half Greek, and
may the gods smite me if I do not look more Greek than
this fellow near me! If it were not for Masistius whom
I love as a brother, I believe I should not tolerate seeing
this fair land over-run by such as Artabazus and
many another eastern despot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Although the wine was not strong enough to intoxicate
if taken in moderation, the spirits of many of
the guests were rising as the evening wore on, owing
to excessive drinking. At length six girls, whose hair
was entwined with daisies, appeared at the entrance to
the court. Each held a lyre and sang as she moved
lightly on tip-toe between the tables. They were modestly
attired so as not to offend the taste of the most
fastidious, for Attaginus was a conservative man and
much respected in Thebes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much for your love of the &aelig;sthetic, Attaginus,&rdquo;
laughed Mardonius, winking at the Theban. &ldquo;In
accordance with your theory why did you not have
some handsome youths dance with the lyre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; replied Attaginus, &ldquo;the male figure
does not appear as well in a dance, but I could have
put on a wrestling match that I think would well have
pleased my guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girls will prove far better entertainers,&rdquo;
said Artabazus, who had overheard the conversation,
&ldquo;but why are their charms so hidden? They might
better be a group of priestesses than dancers amid the
revelry and loud clamor of a banquet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The evening wore on in this fashion, the feasters
trying to out-rival one another in attracting the attention
of the six damsels. When the singing and dancing
were at an end and the maidens had disappeared, the
conversation turned to the more serious matters of the
approaching battle. Mardonius spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Athenians will regret their refusal to form
an alliance with us against the Peleponnesians. Remember
Thermopyl&aelig;, my friend and do not forget that
Salamis was a naval battle. Athens&rsquo; powerful navy
will avail her naught in the approaching conflict.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your great leader speaks most encouragingly,
my friend,&rdquo; said Thersander addressing Zopyrus,
&ldquo;wherefore are you so downcast?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>Zopyrus paused a moment before replying, then
said in a voice low enough to be audible only to his
companion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you have now partaken with me at the same
table, I desire to leave with you some memorial of my
convictions: the rather in order that you may be yourself
forewarned so as to take the best counsel for your
own safety. Do you see these Persians here feasting,
and did you observe the army which we left yonder encamped
near the river? Yet a little while, and out of
all these you will behold but a few surviving!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thersander replied. &ldquo;Surely you are bound to
reveal this to Mardonius and to his confidential advisers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Persian rejoined. &ldquo;My friend, man can not
avert that which God has decreed to come. No one will
believe the revelation, sure though it be. Many of us
Persians know this well, and are here serving only
under the bond of necessity. And truly this is the most
hateful of all human suffering&mdash;to be full of knowledge
and at the same time to have no power over any result.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zopyrus was himself amazed at his own frank outburst.
Many times had he longed thus to express himself,
and so he had revealed to Thersander what he
dared not to his friend Masistius. The east was
kindling into a glorious day as the banqueters took
leave of their host, Attaginus.</p>

<p class="t0">The tale of that mighty field</p>
<p class="t0">Is left to be told by Death.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>Plat&aelig;a lay on the northern slope of beautiful
Mt. Cith&aelig;ron at the foot of which wound the picturesque
river Asopus. On this day in midsummer,
four hundred and seventy-nine B. C., three
hundred thousand Persians and fifty thousand Greek
allies were encamped on the north bank of the river
while the confederate Greek army which numbered one
hundred and ten thousand, waited for the Persian attack
on the slopes of Cith&aelig;ron. Because of unfavorable
advice from soothsayers, both sides hesitated to commence
the assault.</p>
<p>After several days of suspense, Mardonius summoned
his soothsayer to his tent, the same tent occupied
by Xerxes before his return to Asia. The general
sat before a table gazing steadfastly at a parchment
which was spread before him. The soothsayer bowed
and approached Mardonius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you send for me, my lord?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Mardonius lifted a face that was strangely pale
and haggard. &ldquo;Aye, Hegesistratus, I would know the
latest signs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It grieves me that the signs are all unfavorable,
especially in the case of an initiative on the Persian
side,&rdquo; replied the soothsayer.</p>
<p>Mardonius frowned. &ldquo;Can you not tell us what
it were best to do? If you can not I shall find a man
who can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; replied Hegesistratus, &ldquo;I have examined
closely the entrails of every sacrificial animal,
and the signs are the same. Would you know the
truth? I am here to tell you, no matter what that truth
may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mardonius leaned forward clutching the table until
the knuckles of his hands were white. &ldquo;Tell me,
Hegesistratus, am I in imminent danger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seer turned his face slowly away and made no
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak, dog, or your head will be forfeit!&rdquo; cried
the wrathful general.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if you must needs know,&rdquo; responded the
reluctant prophet, &ldquo;you are in grave danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there no hope?&rdquo; asked Mardonius turning
very pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All men pass through certain periods of danger
and such a one is now imminent for you, my lord, but
the time of no man&rsquo;s death is absolutely fated and mayhap
this crisis will pass!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depart and send Masistius to me at once,&rdquo; said
the leader in great agitation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>A few moment later the tent folds parted, admitting
the gigantic form of the cavalryman. The sight of
the heroic figure seemed to cheer Mardonius, for in
place of his customary tones of peremptory command,
he spoke informally, even affectionately to the brave
Persian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Masistius I have decided to delay no longer, for
provisions are low. It is my wish that you lead the Persian
cavalry in an offensive. We number three times
the enemy, therefore why delay longer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that a true soldier wants to know is that he
understands his orders. Your slightest wish is a command,
Mardonius. I shall go at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a brave man, Masistius. Ask what you
will after this encounter, and it shall be granted you.
I will show Hegesistratus what little faith I put in his
soothsaying!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few hours after this Masistius approached
Zopyrus, calling him away from a group of soldiers
with whom he was conversing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zopyrus, I go shortly to charge the enemy and
if the gods will that I do not return, read this and obey
its instructions.&rdquo; So saying he thrust into his friend&rsquo;s
hand a bit of parchment. A few seconds fraught with
emotion and Masistius strode off to obey his superior&rsquo;s
orders.</p>
<p>When the Athenians observed the approach of the
Persian cavalry they descended to the plain below.
Zopyrus stood, a tense figure, behind the barracks. His
bosom swelled with pride as he watched the manly form
of Masistius mounted on a black charger, likewise of
huge proportions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now if I but knew the secret power of the
maiden&rsquo;s prayer!&rdquo; thought he.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>Riding rapidly at the head of the Greek cavalry
was the Athenian Olympiodorus, a white steed bearing
him to the scene of conflict. He was not a man of large
frame, but his attitude of calm self-reliance and his
military bearing gave promise to Masistius that here
was an opponent worthy of the utmost exertion of
belligerent mettle. On came the two principal antagonists,
the distance between them steadily decreasing.
At last they met with a clash of weapons.</p>
<p>The Greek was successful in parrying the stroke
of the Persian. With exceptional agility he dodged
now this way, now that, bringing to naught the superior
strength of his antagonist. At length Olympiodorus
began losing ground. His muscles were tiring under
the continued strain of warding off his opponent&rsquo;s
thrust. Just when it would seem that Masistius could
make the final stab, another horseman rode up to the
assistance of Olympiodorus. In this unequal conflict
Masistius felt himself a loser. He wondered why his
friends did not come to his aid, but was vaguely conscious
that they were busily engaged in battle. Still
he labored on parrying each thrust till he relaxed in
complete exhaustion and a second later fell as the
sword of Olympidiorus&rsquo; helper pierced his vitals. So
perished Masistius, one of the bravest of Mardonius&rsquo;
soldiers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>From his position behind the bulwarks, Zopyrus
witnessed the death of his dearest friend. He stood
for a moment as one in a stupor. His consciousness
seemed gradually to weaken, flicker and die out, then
a new spirit appeared to take hold of him and slowly
gain predominance. After struggling for months with
indecision which was gradually destroying his willpower,
the right course for him to take became unquestionably
apparent. He realized that since the defeat
at Salamis, Masistius had been the only bond that held
him to the Persian despot whose many acts of atrocity
he had viewed with growing aversion. The influence of
his Greek mother had at last gained undeniable supremacy.
She had taught him while it is manly to love one&rsquo;s
country, it is God-like to love the world.</p>
<p>It was a new Zopyrus who turned and with resolute
steps sought the seclusion of his tent. With deferential
fingers he touched the note which his departed
friend had given him and perused it with eyes moist
with unshed tears. It ran as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Zopyrus greetings&mdash;When you read this, my
dear friend, you will know that I am no longer among
the living. My one regret is that I can not carry out
in the body that which I planned. Would it be asking
too much of you, my friend and comrade, to undertake
that which death makes impossible of accomplishment?
Do you remember the eve of the Theban&rsquo;s banquet
when you confessed to me that you loved a Greek
maiden, whom you returned unharmed to her people?
I did not then tell you that a somewhat similar experience
has been mine. But to make this clear to you, I
must go back to that moment upon the Acropolis in
Athens when Xerxes gave to you the girl whom Artabazus
had seized. If you were not too busy with your
own affairs you will remember that after granting this
maid to you, Xerxes then told Artabazus to take the
other girl. I happened to be standing beside Artabazus
at the time, and never shall I forget the agonized expression
upon the Greek maid&rsquo;s face as she felt herself
seized by the Persian. I understand and speak Greek
but poorly, yet I knew what she said. Observing that
I did not enter into the course jests of the other soldiers,
she pled with me to save her from Artabazus, a
thing I would willingly have attempted had it been at
all possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;The memory of her naturally fair face distorted in
the agony of fear, haunted me and I resolved to attempt
a rescue. I knew she was confined in a tent to
the rear of that of Artabazus where a number of
Persian women were kept under guard of a eunuch. I
passed by the tent often that evening under pretext
of official duty beyond. At last I was rewarded by the
sight of a piece of parchment slipped under a fold of the
tent. I placed my foot upon it while I looked about to
be assured no one had witnessed the passing of the
note which read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am a prisoner in the harem of Artabazus. Can
you save me? Artabazus has promised not to harm
me till after the encounter between Greeks and Persians.
This promise was wrung from him principally
through the efforts of a jealous Persian woman who
threatened my life. He and she made a compromise,
the result of which was that I should be forced to surrender
myself to him immediately after the next conflict
regardless of which side came through victorious.
If you can rescue me before the close of another battle,
I will owe you a debt of gratitude which I can never
repay&mdash;Ladice.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;As you are aware, Zopyrus, this occurred at
Phalerum, and since then Persians and Greeks have
not met in conflict until now. I have had other occasions
during the ten months of our sojourn in Thessaly
to secretly communicate with Ladice, and in each of
her messages she has assured me of the strict manner
in which his favorite mistress forces Artabazus to abide
by his word. During this time I felt my heart undergoing
a change from pity to love for this Greek girl
who was so dependent upon my mercy, and upon one
occasion I grew bold enough to write in words my
adoration and hopes for the future. Her answer the
next day contained the happy news that my love was
returned, and I planned on a rescue during the next
conflict, stating that I believed our communications had
better cease in order to decrease the possibility of further
danger. She told me that she believed P&aelig;dime,
the jealous paramour of Artabazus, had suspected the
exchange of our notes, but realizing it to be to her
advantage to allow Ladice to escape, she had maintained
a discreet silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This then is the situation that I leave and that I
trust my friend Zopyrus to take up where fate has
forced me to leave it. May the good-will of Ahura-Mazd&acirc;o
follow you in all your efforts throughout life&mdash;Masistius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The changed Zopyrus sat a moment buried in deepest
thought. Without he heard the noises which accompany
preparation for battle. He hurried forth into
the open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are Mardonius&rsquo; orders?&rdquo; he asked of the
first soldier he saw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look for yourself,&rdquo; cried the fellow excitedly,
&ldquo;and you will know what his orders must be.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>Zopyrus turned his gaze to the slopes of Cith&aelig;ron
and saw that the Greeks who had held back reservedly
were now, emboldened by the death of a prominent
opponent, pouring down the verdant hillside. The well-aimed
arrows of the Persians, however, kept them at
bay.</p>
<p>Zopyrus spied several of the Persian leaders in
heated argument. As he approached, the Theban,
Timegenidas, was speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know well, Mardonius, that their water supply
from the Asopus river is completely cut off. Where
are they able to get water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just been informed,&rdquo; replied the leader,
&ldquo;that they are getting water from a fountain called
Gargaphia, yonder,&rdquo; and he pointed to the east. &ldquo;Will
you, Zopyrus, investigate this fountain? Take another
man with you this very night and see if it will be possible
to fill the fountain with dirt and stones. If we
can do this we may well be sanguine of success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The commander turned to Artabazus. &ldquo;Does the
plan meet with your approval, Artabazus?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Entirely, Mardonius. I am weary of warfare
and only too glad to try any plan that may bring the
quickest results.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Zopyrus only did this remark have any special
significance. He knew that Artabazus was thinking
of the fair captive whom he was to possess as soon as
the battle was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; cried Zopyrus, &ldquo;the Greeks are retreating.
Our arrows have held them in check. At this time
tomorrow there will be a surprise in store!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>It was true. The Greeks were fleeing from the
open plain to the shady recesses of the mountain, there
to rally for a renewed defense on the morrow.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>On the silken covers of a couch in a remote corner
of the tent which was occupied by the women of the
harem of Artabazus, lay the grief-stricken form of the
Greek captive, Ladice. She had been informed of the
death of Masistius, and with that realization had come
also the awful knowledge that soon she would be the
property of the Persian Artabazus, whose lewdness
was the common talk of the camp. Her brows were
delicately arched and her long lashes swept her cheeks
meeting the flush of color brought to her face as a
result of hours of feverish weeping. Her hair, brown
with a gleam of copper, hung over her partially bare
shoulders.</p>
<p>Hovering above her with contemptuous gaze, was
the Persian girl, Ph&aelig;dime, the reigning queen of
Artabazus&rsquo; harem until the close of the battle of
Plat&aelig;a. Her full lips were twisted into a sneer, and
there was a venomous light in the almond-shaped eyes
of jet. Her blue-black hair was parted above a low
white brow and hung in long, thick, glossy braids over
her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So your lover is dead!&rdquo; she said tauntingly.
&ldquo;You can not regret that fact more than I, for I had
hoped to see him take you away from Artabazus, but
Artabazus is mine, do you hear? Do you think I can
bear to see you in his arms? I have promised not to
kill you, but I will try to assist you to escape if you
can do so without these others knowing what I have
done.&rdquo; She indicated the other women in the tent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible,&rdquo; sobbed Ladice. &ldquo;The eyes of
that hideous eunuch are forever upon me and there are
armed guards without.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ph&aelig;dime bent over the prostrate form in a more
menacing attitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you do not want to go,&rdquo; she said between
closed teeth, &ldquo;but I will make it so unpleasant
for you here that you will be glad to go even if suicide
offers the only hope for escape. Mark my words well,
for I make no idle threats!&rdquo; With which words she
left the unhappy Greek prisoner.</p>

</div>
<p>Now in the fitful lurid glow of a hundred campfires,
now in the gloomy shadows of tents or
trees, Zopyrus crept stealthily toward the tent
of Artabazus. It was approaching midnight, and with
the exception of the occupants of Mardonius&rsquo; tent, the
Persians slept, many of them for the last time before
their eternal rest. Less than fifteen minutes had
elapsed since Zopyrus had quitted the tent of Mardonius,
leaving the Persian and Theban leaders in a
heated discussion pertaining to the morrow&rsquo;s battle.
He felt assured that affairs of war would detain Artabazus
for at least a half hour and possibly longer. The
tent of Artabazus, though at no great distance from
that of Mardonius, was difficult of access, and Zopyrus
realized that his work must be accomplished not only
swiftly, but silently as well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>A guard walking back and forth before the entrance
to the women&rsquo;s tent was the only living soul
visible; his measured tread the only sound audible.
Zopyrus stood like an inanimate object beside a low
bush near the tent. He watched the guard for some
time, studying the opportune moment to spring. Now
the fellow&rsquo;s march brought him so close to the hidden
figure that the latter had but to reach forth his hand&mdash;A
muffled cry of bewilderment, a brief struggle, a suppressed
groan of agony, and Zopyrus leaped over the
prostrate form and entered the tent of the women.</p>
<p>The eunuch, a creature of repulsive form and
malignant countenance, stood just within the entrance.
The noise of the struggle, brief and silent though it
was, had reached his ears. With the stealth and agility
of a panther he approached and leaped upon his prey
as the latter entered. With dagger raised aloft he
would have dealt a fatal blow had not Ph&aelig;dime with the
strength of an Amazon, held his arm as it was about
to descend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, Amorges,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;do not harm this
man till we learn his mission!&rdquo; Turning to Zopyrus
she said, &ldquo;Speak stranger, what would you in the
harem of Artabazus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zopyrus glanced quickly about him at the silken
hangings richly broidered; at the heavy woven tapestries
which adorned the sides of the tent; at panels
composed of the variegated plumage of birds, and
gloriously flashing jewels; the beautifully gowned
women who surveyed him with unabashed curiosity,
their shining black eyes flashing their appreciation of
the unusual over the tops of fans of ostrich feathers.
He turned again to Ph&aelig;dime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seek one Ladice by name, a Greek girl brought
here against her will.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just a moment, I will bring her.&rdquo; To the eunuch
she whispered aside, &ldquo;I will fetch a gag. Do not touch
him yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She returned shortly with Ladice whose appearance
of unutterable wretchedness wrung Zopyrus&rsquo;
heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This officer says he has come to take you away,
Ladice,&rdquo; said Ph&aelig;dime giving a sidelong glance at the
girl to observe her reception of the news.</p>
<p>The Greek maiden took a step forward, gazing
earnestly into Zopyrus&rsquo; face. &ldquo;It is not he, no it is
not he! But tell me he is not dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zopyrus spoke gently, &ldquo;I must confirm the ill
news, fair maiden. Masistius died heroically on the
field of battle and I am to succeed him in an attempt to
rescue you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amorges and Ph&aelig;dime exchanged glances, the
former intimating by a nod that it was time to produce
the gag, but Ph&aelig;dime still hesitated, for the girl,
Ladice, flung herself with a sob at Zopyrus&rsquo; feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be true,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I loved him and he
promised to return, oh tell me it isn&rsquo;t true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zopyrus gazed with compassion into the tear-stained
face as he replied: &ldquo;It is indeed true, but tell
me, do you really wish to escape from the clutches of
Artabazus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl glanced furtively about her in horror as
if she expected to see the odious form conjured before
her at the mention of his name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will do anything to escape from him and
if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; but her words were cut short by a muffled
cry of terror.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>Ph&aelig;dime had seized the eunuch and forced the gag
into his mouth. &ldquo;Come, help me bind him!&rdquo; she
called loudly to Zopyrus.</p>
<p>It was the work of a few moments, and when they
were finished, poor Amorges lay in one corner of the
tent, prone and helpless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may depend upon me to help you in this
project,&rdquo; Ph&aelig;dime said to Zopyrus. &ldquo;It is necessary
to lay bare to you the secrets of a woman&rsquo;s heart. I
love Artabazus, and in his affections I have held first
place till this Greek girl,&rdquo; (here she cast a scornful
glance at Ladice), &ldquo;was brought here, and after this
battle was fought she would have been his. You see
it is to my interest to get her away and to that end I
will lend you my assistance. Perhaps we had better
kill the eunuch to be assured of our safety. What say
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amorges&rsquo; eyes fairly started out of their sockets
as the two approached. Seeing that the threat had
proved effectual, Ph&aelig;dime spurned the defenceless
body with her foot and asked: &ldquo;Will you intimate to
Artabazus upon his return that violence was done you
by the soldier who rescued Ladice, and that I tried
to help you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wretched fellow indicated affirmation as well
as his bonds permitted and Ph&aelig;dime turned to Zopyrus
and Ladice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now go and may success crown your efforts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before we go,&rdquo; said Zopyrus to Ladice, &ldquo;you
must don this garb to facilitate our escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held out to her a bundle of dark clothing. The
girl withdrew to an adjoining chamber and soon appeared
in the uniform of a Persian foot-soldier.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your disguise is excellent,&rdquo; exclaimed Zopyrus
delightedly, &ldquo;now let us hasten,&rdquo; and with a brief expression
of gratitude to Ph&aelig;dime for her share in the
escape, he and Ladice took a hasty departure.</p>
<p>Only the glowing embers of camp-fires remained.
The flickering deceptive shadows that had annoyed
Zopyrus in his approach to the harem-tent had disappeared,
and in their stead the encampment lay
around the fugitives in the tranquil light of a full moon,
the white tents gleaming like snow-covered hillocks.
Already the Persian felt that this omen presaged success.
They threaded the narrow alleys which separated
the tents in silence so as not to betray their presence,
and arrived without mishap at an intersection
of alleys, about thirty yards from the tent of Mardonius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us turn to the left here,&rdquo; whispered Zopyrus,
&ldquo;and thus avoid passing Mardonius&rsquo; tent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely had the words escaped his lips when the
sound of footsteps and low talking broke the silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your hurry? Why will you not abide
the night with Mardonius till we decide whether or not
it is advisable to attempt to cut off the Greek reinforcements?&rdquo;
questioned the voice of Asopodorus.</p>
<p>Then to the horror of the fugitives, the voice of
Artabazus made answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow will be time enough for that. I am
weary of consultations of war, and who knows if I be
living tomorrow at this time! I have a fair Greek captive
who will this night help me to forget the dangers
of the morrow, and to her I now go despite my promises
to await the close of battle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>It was now too late to turn without arousing the
suspicion of the approaching Artabazus. Zopyrus
could feel the trembling hand of the girl upon his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have courage,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;and say not a
word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Artabazus&rsquo; features expressed surprise at meeting
anyone at this time of the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well if it isn&rsquo;t Zopyrus! Have you turned somnambulist?&rdquo;
he asked jocosely, but with a hint of mistrust
in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget, Artabazus, the task I am this night
to perform at the fountain of Gargaphia. By the time
I reach its vicinity the moon will be low.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure I remember now, but whom have you
with you?&rdquo; questioned the officer curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mardonius bade me take a man with me, and this
youth wished to go,&rdquo; replied Zopyrus with an air of indifference.</p>
<p>Artabazus looked disapprovingly at the slight
figure of the foot-soldier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t look very capable,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless he is courageous, and though young,
I decided to try him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; asked Artabazus of the
silent figure.</p>
<p>The question took Zopyrus completely by surprise,
but with joy he observed that Ladice maintained discreet
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name is Ladisius,&rdquo; answered Zopyrus, &ldquo;and
now if you will permit, we must be on our way, for a
great deal depends upon this mission.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>As soon as Artabazus was out of hearing, Zopyrus
said to his companion. &ldquo;That was indeed a narrow
escape and now we must hasten with all possible speed,
for Artabazus will begin pursuit as soon as he learns
of your escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt! Give the password,&rdquo; demanded the sentry
at the edge of the encampment.</p>
<p>Zopyrus easily made known his identity to the sentinel
who was apprised of his mission to Gargaphia.
Once beyond the confines of the camp the two breathed
more freely. The soft breeze which fanned their
cheeks was laden with the vernal odors of field and
forest. The meadows through which they sped, were
dotted with field lilies and asphodel, myriads of them,
their white blossoms gleaming from the grass like the
stars from the heavens till it seemed to the fugitives
that in their flight earth and sky had changed places and
that they trod the milky-way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far is it to the fountain of Gargaphia?&rdquo;
asked Ladice after they had gone for some time in
silence.</p>
<p>Zopyrus paused a moment, scanning his companion&rsquo;s
face to ascertain whether or not she had put her
question seriously. Assured that she was in earnest,
he continued his pace, talking the while.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are not with a Persian soldier as you suppose,
my little friend. Zopyrus, the Persian, ceased to
exist when he witnessed the death of his comrade,
Masistius. My father was a Persian, satrap of Sardis,
my mother a Greek whose parents were Athenians.
My environment forced me to don uniform and follow
the Persian king, but the natural heritage from my
mother, and her early tutelage, caused my soul to cry
out continually against the actions of my body. For
months I was a prey of weakness and indecision. My
every act was accomplished after agonizing periods of
vacillation. My will-power was being destroyed and
though cognizant of the fact, I seemed powerless to
retrieve the volition I once possessed. With the death
of Masistius all bonds of honor with the Persians
seemed severed, and I pledged myself to save Athens
if it were not already too late. If I seem a traitor in
your eyes, judge me not too harshly. Gold is not my
motive, for I shall be poorer for this choice I have
made; safety is no object, for I intend to make atonement
by wielding the sword in the Greek cause. Have
I convinced you, fair maid, that my incentives are pure,
and that I do well to allow this determination to supercede
my former hesitancy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was satisfied with her ready nod of assent. At
last they reached the entrance to Oak Heads pass, by
which means they would be enabled to cross Mt.
Cith&aelig;ron. Their progress was greatly impeded by the
dense tangle of underbrush. The branches of trees
met overhead, forming a canopy of foliage so thick that
the moon&rsquo;s beams could not penetrate. For hours the
crackling of twigs underfoot, and an occasional hoot
from some night-owl were the only sounds that disturbed
the tranquility of the night.</p>
<p>Suddenly Ladice stopped and asked abruptly:
&ldquo;Did you hear that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied her companion, &ldquo;I heard a slight
sound, but I think it is a prowling beast on some nocturnal
journey. Stay close and keep your hand upon
your dagger for you may have to use it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>Scarcely had he ceased to speak before a command
in Greek was given to halt and give the password.
Before Ladice could realize what had happened, she
heard the sounds of struggle. Her eyes, accustomed to
the darkness, could faintly discern the gleam of
weapons, but she dared not strike for she could not distinguish
between the antagonists. She soon realized
that they were not fighting near her, and a sudden fear
seized her; they might miss their footing and slip over
the edge of the declivity! She decided to raise her
voice in warning, when the unmistakable sound of
breaking twigs and loosened stones rolling down the
precipice, convinced her that her worst fears were an
actuality. Stunned with horror she stood for some
time unable to decide what to do. At last dreading that
Artabazus might by now be well on his way in pursuit
of her, she pressed on in an agony of fear. The foliage
was now a little thinner and she could see the first faint
glow of dawn in the sky. Her physical progress was
more rapid, but mentally she was stupified by the horror
of her rescuer&rsquo;s fate, and she did not hear the
sounds of approaching footsteps till they were immediately
behind her.</p>
<p>Her first expression was one of relief that her pursuer
was not Artabazus, but she observed with chagrin
that he wore a Greek uniform. Raising her eyes half
fearfully to his face she uttered an exclamation of joy.
It was Zopyrus!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad I did not have to kill the fellow to get
this uniform, for I am a Greek. His neck was broken
in the fall and as for me&mdash;&rdquo; he pointed to his right
arm which hung useless by his side, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I shall
not be of much service to Greece!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ladice opened her knapsack and tore from her
dress a strip with which she dexterously bandaged the
broken member. This done, she discarded the Persian
uniform for the torn dress and together they descended
the southern slope of Mt. Cith&aelig;ron as the roseate hues
of morning gradually melted away into bright daylight.</p>

<p class="lr">William Cullen Bryant.</p>
</div>
<p>Artabazus&rsquo; steps were directed to the tent of
the women. With heavy tread he strode in the
panoply of war. At the corner of the tent his
foot came in rough contact with a soft object and to his
amazement he discovered it to be the body of his
guard. A hasty examination assured him that the body
was lifeless. Filled with forebodings, he hastily parted
the flaps and gazed within the tent. His eyes first fell
upon the prostrate form of his eunuch, then with a
swift glance he surveyed the women, and he knew what
had taken place during his absence.</p>
<p>White with fury he cried, &ldquo;Where is the Greek
girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His appearance in his wrathful state was so forbidding
that not one of the women ventured to make
reply. Upon receiving no response, Artabazus turned
to Ph&aelig;dime, whereupon his favorite, with an assumption
of her usual self assurance, made bold to answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;A Persian officer killed the guard, bound
Amorges here, and bore Ladice away with him. Is it
not so?&rdquo; Ph&aelig;dime turned to her fair companions to
confirm her words, confident in her position as favorite.</p>
<p>All readily affirmed the escape as stated by
Ph&aelig;dime with the exception of a small oval-faced
beauty with shining black hair and ruddy lips, that
would not refuse to smile at her master even in his
state of demoniac anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What say you, Parysatis?&rdquo; questioned the officer,
noting her refusal to corroborate Ph&aelig;dime&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If my master would know the truth,&rdquo; smiled
Parysatis, &ldquo;Ph&aelig;dime herself allowed the Greek girl to
be taken away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An ominous silence of horror pervaded the tent
for a moment while all eyes were turned to Artabazus,
who in livid rage seized the hapless Ph&aelig;dime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are hurting me,&rdquo; she cried in abject terror. &ldquo;Can
you not know that what I did was because of love
for you? Oh, my Artabazus, if you but commanded it,
I would crawl from here to the Hellespont, where I
long to cross with you back to the land where we meet
no Greeks either in warfare or in love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Persian commander laughed wildly, a laugh
that froze the blood in the veins of his hearers. &ldquo;You
will never cross the Hellespont nor even leave this tent
alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a flash of gleaming steel, a hissing
sound, and the headless trunk of the Persian beauty
sank before its murderer.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>During the time that Zopyrus and Ladice made
good their escape from the Persian encampment and
were beginning to pursue their precarious way across
Mt. Cith&aelig;ron, the Greek encampment lay in the stillness
of sleep. Above the tents rose the gentle, picturesque
slope of the mountain, where beyond the space which
had been cleared, the forest stretched in black silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>In one of the tents well toward the forest edge of
the encampment, three young men sat around a small
table upon which a candle sent forth its flickering light.
Presently one of them arose with an impatient gesture
and strode back and forth with restless energy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ails you, Cimon?&rdquo; questioned one of the
two who were seated. He was a thin wiry fellow, whose
face showed the tan of continued exposure to the
elements. His nose was aquiline, his lips thin and
his eye penetrating, but withal, kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing new, Icetes, but before tomorrow&rsquo;s battle
I should like to know if Ladice is confined in the
harem of one of the Persian leaders as I have heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till the battle is over, and if Zeus grants
us the victory, demand the return of the girl. The
harems of the Persians will be ours then, and to such
a brave soldier as you have proved yourself to be,
Pausanias will gladly give first choice of the spoils,&rdquo;
said Icetes, rising from his chair and placing a friendly
hand upon the other&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>Cimon smiled wanly. &ldquo;Perhaps you are right, my
friend,&rdquo; he acquiesced &ldquo;but you can not know how I
suffer! Has Eros never found you vulnerable here?&rdquo;
Cimon placed both hands upon his heart and smiled
with a questioning glance at Icetes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;If Eros has ever found him so, it was not for
the love of a maiden who possesses a heart of stone as
does this Ladice whom you adore,&rdquo; remarked the third
youth who up till the present moment had remained a
silent observing listener.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be still, Ephialtes,&rdquo; said Icetes gruffly. &ldquo;Cimon
suffers enough without your reproaches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him suffer,&rdquo; said the youth indifferently.
&ldquo;If he wants her badly enough let him go to the Persian
encampment and get her! He does not know nor
do you, Icetes, what the result of tomorrow&rsquo;s struggle
will be. What if the enemy comes out victorious and
the Persian leader carries the fair Ladice across the
Hellespont? No doubt she has already yielded to his
kisses and is beginning to enjoy the luxurious ease of
an oriental harem. Women are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>With an oath Cimon rushed at Ephialtes, but
Icetes interposed himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; he pled in a hoarse whisper, &ldquo;your
altercation will be heard by Pausanias himself. Let us
sit down quietly again and maybe we can arrive at a
definite conclusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Icetes and Ephialtes seated themselves, but Cimon
began to put on his armor piece by piece till he stood
before them fully armed. They watched him wonderingly
but ventured no inquiry. Then he strode toward
the entrance and turning to face them, said, &ldquo;I am
going to find Ladice and bring her back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ephialtes smiled in a contemptuous manner, but
Icetes was on his feet in an instant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;By Zeus,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you shall not attempt such
a rash undertaking. You, the son of the brave
Miltiades, are needed for the morrow&rsquo;s battle. Your
counsel and advice are indispensable. Next to Pausanias
we need you, just <i>you</i>, to show these barbarians
that they can no longer abide within our borders.
Think of it, my brave Cimon, Mardonius killed and
the other leaders routed at Plat&aelig;a! Make it the last
battle of the last war with them! Don&rsquo;t leave us at
this critical period to satisfy a personal longing. Your
father did that, Cimon, but not till he had fought
Marathon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words of Icetes had an enervating effect upon
Cimon. He drooped perceptibly and then slowly he
began to disarm. When the last piece of armor had
been cast aside, he dropped into his chair again, and
folding his arms upon the table, buried his face in them.
His broad shoulders heaved, and in the silence that
followed, an occasional groan was heard. Even
Ephialtes&rsquo; supercilious air left him in the presence of
this real grief of a fellow-man.</p>
<p>Cimon&rsquo;s agony was too much for the kind-hearted
Icetes. Rising and bending above the bowed form of
the son of Miltiades, Icetes said in earnest tones. &ldquo;Let
me go this night and search for Ladice. I am acquainted
with her father, Mamercus, who as you know
perished at Salamis, probably unknown to his daughter
who will now be alone if she returns to Athens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cimon made a sign of remonstrance before he was
able to speak. &ldquo;No, my friend,&rdquo; he said, when he had
found voice, &ldquo;I can not think of endangering the life
of another in the performance of a task which concerns
me so personally. I will give up what you consider
a foolish enterprise, but I fear I have lost the zest for
the morrow&rsquo;s battle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will go for you Cimon,&rdquo; Icetes cried eagerly, as
he went for his armor, &ldquo;My part in tomorrow&rsquo;s conflict
will be indirect, but it will be a vital part nevertheless.
If by putting heart in you through this service,
I thus enable you to fight bravely tomorrow, I shall
indeed feel that I have helped to expel the Persians
from Greece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cimon saw that opposition was useless. His eyes
met for an instant the ironical gaze of Ephialtes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine that rendering a real service to a
fellow-man is quite foreign to your nature, Ephialtes,&rdquo;
Cimon could not resist saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; replied the young Greek unruffled,
&ldquo;I recently rendered a very great service to a
very illustrious person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no doubt you were handsomely paid for
your efforts, the agreement having been made before
hand,&rdquo; answered Cimon as he rose to bid farewell to
Icetes who stood ready to take his leave.</p>
<p>The sight of the brave fellow clad in the panoply
of war, about to risk his life for a friend, moved Cimon
deeply. Words seemed inadequate to convey the gratitude
he felt. The two parted after a warm embrace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XI.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A Hero of Plat&aelig;a.</span></h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Here where the Persian clarion rung,</p>
<p class="t0">And where the Spartan sword flashed high,</p>
<p class="t0">And where the P&aelig;an strains were sung,</p>
<p class="t0">From year to year swelled on by liberty!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="lr">Felicia Hemans.</p>
</div>
<p>The market-place of Plat&aelig;a was the scene of rejoicing
over the victory of the Spartans.
Pausanias, the Spartan leader, nephew of the
brave Leonidas, conducted solemn sacrificial services.</p>
<p>Their victory had seemed almost a miracle, for the
Athenians and Spartans had begun a retreat to an
island formed by two forks of the river Oeroe. The
Persians, when they saw that the Greeks were retreating,
pursued them. The Athenians were ahead, and
the Spartans being behind were overtaken by the disorderly
Persian horde. The Athenians learning of the
encounter, decided to return to the assistance of their
allies, but were attacked by the Thebans before they
could act upon their decision. From behind the breastwork
of shields the Persians shot their arrows bravely,
and for awhile the outcome was doubtful but Pausanias
and his brave Spartans succeeded in killing Mardonius.
With their leader dead, the Persians lost their fervor
and fled in disorder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>In the meanwhile the encounter between the
Athenians and Thebans became more serious. When
the battle had reached its crisis, both the Athenians
and the Thebans observed a tall figure in the garb of
a Greek soldier fighting amid the Thebans like a fiend,
and what amazed the Greeks most was that he fought
with his left arm only, the other being supported by a
bandage which hung from his shoulder. He seemed to
bear a charmed life. Before his sword the Thebans
fell, and the Athenians pressing around him were able
to work havoc in his wake.</p>
<p>Suddenly a Theban sprang in front of the one-armed
fighting warrior and cried as he crossed swords
with him, &ldquo;I swear you are the Persian with whom I
dined and exchanged confidences at the feast of
Attaginus. You shall pay for your treason with your
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other smiled grimly but said not a word as
he entered into the encounter, and before long this
antagonist like the others, lay with the point of the
Athenian&rsquo;s sword at his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Thersander,&rdquo; cried the victorious one, &ldquo;do
you surrender to Zopyrus the Athenian, or do you meet
death at his sword?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Theban surrendered as had many another of
his countrymen on that day, and history tells us that
among the captives was Attaginus, the only one of the
number who succeeded later in making his escape. The
wicked Artabazus instead of coming to the aid of the
Persians after Mardonius fell, fled with his troops
through Phocis to Thessaly, Macedonia and the Hellespont,
and the fair Parysatis accompanied him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>So it was no wonder that Plat&aelig;a was the scene of
much rejoicing upon this occasion. Pausanias, though
enthusiastically lauded by both Spartans and Athenians,
did not accept the great honor bestowed upon
him alone. He said that if he were the hero of the
Spartans over the Persians, so likewise was the
stranger who fought with but one arm, the hero of the
Athenians over the Thebans. When asked who he was,
Zopyrus merely stated that he was a loyal Athenian
who had been away from Athens for a number of years,
which statement he could make without distorting the
truth.</p>
<p>Pausanias stood surrounded by the booty acquired
in the victory over Mardonius. The vast cables of
papyrus which had composed the bridge of Xerxes
when he first crossed the Hellespont, were here displayed;
likewise the silver-footed throne and the cimeter
of Mardonius and the sword and breastplate of
Masistius.</p>
<p>Many beautiful women who had been in the harems
of the Persian leaders were either sold or given to
those who had displayed exceptional bravery. Of these
Zopyrus was offered first choice, but to Pausanias&rsquo; surprise
he politely declined. Stepping over to the pile
where were stacked the swords, breastplates, shields,
helmets and smaller articles of pillage, Zopyrus drew
forth the sword of Masistius and made the statement
that this would be a most acceptable portion of the
spoils to him. The Greeks wondered at his choice,
but no one made so bold as to question him concerning
it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>As Zopyrus was about to leave the market-place
someone placed a detaining hand upon his shoulder.
Turning, the former looked into the face of a young
man of about his own height and physique but a few
years his senior, who smilingly offered his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to commend you for your bravery in the
recent battle and to welcome you back to Athens, as
I understand you have not been there for some years
past. I am Cimon, and this,&rdquo; he indicated a slender
man by his side, &ldquo;is Polygnotus, an artist of no mean
reputation. We are both residing in Athens and shall
be glad to have you meet others of our friends in the
city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zopyrus was greatly pleased. From the handsome
countenance of Cimon he turned to look at the artist,
Polygnotus. Although in Greek military dress,
Polygnotus did not appear a soldier. His features
were thin, almost delicate, his nose aquiline and his
mouth super-sensitive. His hair of light brown, very
smooth and straight, was dressed on the prevailing
style with the braids crossed at the back of the head
and fastened in front. His eyes were searching and
possessed a mild lustre indicative of a fine degree of
intellectuality and a broad sympathetic understanding
of his fellow men. Zopyrus recognized in him at once
a kindred mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you no doubt know,&rdquo; said the artist, &ldquo;our
homes are in ashes but we are returning to rebuild
them, determined to lose no time in mourning our
losses, but rejoicing that the enemy is forever expelled.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Cimon had turned away and with another soldier
sought the platform where beautiful women, many of
them Greeks, stood exposed to the rude gaze of the
soldiery. Zopyrus&rsquo; eyes followed the retreating form
of Cimon and a question arose to his lips which was
anticipated by the quiet Polygnotus who said: &ldquo;You
wonder at Cimon&rsquo;s interest in the women and I can
assure you his motives are pure. He is searching for
the girl he loves who was taken captive by one of the
Persian leaders and confined in his harem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was her name?&rdquo; asked Zopyrus tensely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladice,&rdquo; was the anticipated, but at the same
time astounding reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The maiden has been rescued from the harem of
Artabazus,&rdquo; said Zopyrus quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you absolutely certain?&rdquo; cried the artist
incredulously.</p>
<p>At the other&rsquo;s nod he cried, &ldquo;Come with me, I
must inform Cimon of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cimon saw the two approaching and hastened forward
to join them with the words: &ldquo;Ladice is not
among the captive women, so it is reasonable to believe
that Icetes effected a rescue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stranger can confirm our hopes,&rdquo; said
Polygnotus. &ldquo;He has told me that Ladice was rescued
from the harem of a certain Artabazus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cimon turned to Zopyrus, his face white with the
effort to conceal the agony of suspense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she now on her way to Athens with her rescuer?&rdquo;
he asked tensely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do not quite understand you,&rdquo; replied Zopyrus.
&ldquo;I, myself rescued an Athenian maiden by the name of
Ladice from the tent of Artabazus. I conducted her in
safety across Oak Heads Pass. She then suggested
that I go to the Greek encampment on Mt. Cith&aelig;ron,
insisting she could make her way alone to friends in
safety since she was away from the Persians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zeus is merciful!&rdquo; exclaimed the overwrought
Cimon, &ldquo;but tell me saw you aught of a soldier while
you were crossing Oak Heads Pass? You must have
met him a little this side of the summit. It was he
whom I thought had delivered Ladice from the hands
of the Persian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The face of Zopyrus grew deathly pale at Cimon&rsquo;s
words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I did meet a soldier on Oak
Heads Pass who took me for an enemy without a
chance for explanation. We fought together, and in
the dark we missed our footing and rolled down a
steep embankment. I sustained this broken arm,&rdquo; he
pointed to the sling which supported the broken member,
&ldquo;but my unknown antagonist was killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my poor Icetes!&rdquo; cried Cimon greatly distraught.
&ldquo;To think that you met your fate thus, and
for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polygnotus touched his friend&rsquo;s arm gently;
&ldquo;Icetes would probably have lost his life in the battle,
for he was very daring. His was a noble though useless
sacrifice, but let us rejoice that Ladice has been
saved. You owe much to our new friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am truly grateful, Zopyrus,&rdquo; said Cimon
grasping the hand of the other, &ldquo;but how did you come
to rescue the girl whom I love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a note of distrust in his voice though
he strove to conceal it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a long story that I will tell you at some
other time,&rdquo; replied Zopyrus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>As the three walked away from the public square,
Cimon placed an arm across the shoulder of Zopyrus,
for he was involuntarily drawn toward this attractive
stranger, in spite of his former suspicions. But Zopyrus
was pained by his own duplicity as he thought of
how recently he had been in Persian uniform. When
he would tell his new friend &ldquo;the long story, some other
time,&rdquo; his conscience would be clear, but for the present
it hurt him to realize that Cimon&rsquo;s arm had been
laid in brotherly affection upon that same uniform,
when not he, but the dead Icetes, had worn it.</p>

</div>
<p>Instead of returning immediately to Athens, following
the expulsion of the Persians, Zopyrus and
his new-found friend, Cimon, turned their faces
northward. Tempted by the beauty of the starry nights
and the absence of wayfarers, the two usually journeyed
after the golden orb of the sun had disappeared
beyond the watery horizon of the Corinthian Gulf.
Along this road that skirted the gulf, the hordes of
Xerxes had marched.</p>

northward filled Zopyrus&rsquo; heart with stirring emotions,
and in the dewy silence of the nights that followed their
departure from Plat&aelig;a, Zopyrus revealed to Cimon
his peculiar identity and laid bare to this sympathetic
friend the emotions that had at first stirred and finally
swayed his soul from the time that he had left his
native Sardis up to the present moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>Cimon was a sympathetic and wondering listener.
This young man&rsquo;s experiences were so antipodal to his
own that they interested him exceedingly. A week
passed in this pleasant exchange of ideas and
confidences until toward sundown of the eighth day, the
purple crown of Mt. Helicon loomed in the distance
and the two knew that in another day their journey
would be completed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not believe that Melpomene sits alone on
Mt. Parnassus now,&rdquo; remarked Zopyrus meditatively,
more to himself than to his companion, as the two
caught their first glimpse of the lofty dwelling place of
the Muses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; asked Cimon, puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied the other with a short laugh to
cover his confusion, &ldquo;I was just giving expression to
an extremely fanciful idea that occurred to me when
I passed through this gorge on my way to Athens. I
imagined that surely in the face of an invading foe,
no Muse but the sorrowful Melpomene could occupy
yonder height.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were surely mistaken, friend Zopyrus,&rdquo; said
the other with a seriousness that proved how highly
he esteemed this young man&rsquo;s opinions. &ldquo;Would not
Clio, for instance, have been there to record events that
will go down in history, and surely you can not imagine
that Callio was in hiding when Aeschylus wrote his inspired
verse so soon after the victory of Salamis!
Aye, and Thalia too, had a vision of the future and
knew that ere a year had passed, two friends, one who
had helped in his infinitesimal way to swell the ranks
of Xerxes, and one who, insignificant as compared with
the many heroes of Hellas, would pass together in
the bond of a lasting friendship beneath her very
abode! I do not believe that any of the Muses or any
of the gods ever desert mortals, but we finite beings
are incapable of comprehending their plan for us in
the process of its unfolding.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>Zopyrus thought of the monotheistic belief of the
Hellenic maiden whose act of supplication he had witnessed
on the promontory overlooking the Bay of
Salamis, but he said nothing, for he had an inner feeling
that the stalwart, aristocratic Greek who walked
beside him was as yet unready for a belief in but one
ruling Divinity. That he loved the deities of Greece
was evident from the rapt gaze which he now turned to
the lofty summit of Mt. Parnassus. Was he aware
that there were Greeks of the purest blood who were
turning from the ancient gods and exalting Zeus apparently
out of all due proportion? Strange emotions
filled Zopyrus&rsquo; heart, for he too marveled at the
thought that belief in the gods might no longer sway
the destinies of the Greeks.</p>
<p>The two young men perceived that the road turned
away from the water-side and zig-zagged across a picturesque
ridge. It was now broad daylight and they
met occasional pedestrians who were returning from
consultations with the oracle of Apollo. What sorrows
and ambitions, what joys or what despair were
locked in the heart of each one? Very likely these
travelers had sought the oracle upon personal matters
since their national crisis had so recently passed to
their great advantage. Here an old man with slow and
feeble steps probably wished to know the time yet
allotted to him upon earth; there a mother with anxious
care-worn countenance whose boy had not yet returned
from Plat&aelig;a, and beside her a young wife whose husband
might have perished on the field of battle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Cimon and Zopyrus did not stop to converse with
any of the wayfarers for they desired to return to
Athens as quickly as possible after their interview
with the Pythoness. Presently they found themselves
in a rugged and romantic glen, closed on the north by
the wall-like cliffs of Mt. Parnassus, on the east by a
ridge similar to the one they had just crossed, and on
the south by the irregular heights of Mt. Kirphis, and
in this glen stood a simple Ionic temple surrounded
by many smaller buildings; the treasuries of various
cities and islands of Greece. Their outlines were
softened by vines and shrubbery in abundance. The
tall trees and towering crags of the mount of the Muses
allowed the entrance of only such sunlight as filtered
through the less leafy trees. The air was cool and
laden with the dank odor of growing things.</p>
<p>The two suppliants at the shrine of Apollo, after
passing by the treasury of Thebes, approached that
of Athens which was a beautiful little Doric temple of
Parian marble, containing and partly built from the
spoils of the battle of Marathon. Cimon paused to read
an inscription engraved on a low parapet that supported
armor captured from the Persians in that great
battle. His heart swelled with pride at the consciousness
that it was his father who had so successfully
routed the Persians on the plain of Marathon. He ventured
a glance at Zopyrus and was convinced that a
loyal Greek stood by his side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>The long low edifice just beyond the Treasury of
the Athenians was the Bouleuterion above which rose
a rough mass of rock, the Rock of the Sibyl. A priest
of Apollo at the entrance of the Bouleuterion gave
each of the young men a wax tablet and stylus with
which it was intended that he write the question that
he wished answered by the Sibyl whose duty it was to
make known the will of the god whose organ of inspiration
she was. The question that appeared on the tablet
of each was the same; &ldquo;Shall I win the maiden I
love?&rdquo; The priest took the tablets and withdrew to
the rock where the priestess, a virgin clad in white,
having chewed the leaves of the sacred laurel and
drunk from the prophetic underground stream, Kassotis,
sat upon a tripod above a fissure in the rock from
which a mystic vapor arose by which she soon became
inspired. Her mutterings and ravings were interpreted
by the priest who wrote them below the questions
in verse.</p>
<p>As was customary the men did not remain near
during the trance of the medium, but sought the Castalian
Fountain which was east of the sacred precinct
at the head of a wild and picturesque gorge. The fountain
was in front of a smooth face of rock, the water
issuing from a rock at the right and being carried
through a channel to an opening at the extreme left.</p>
<p>Cimon and Zopyrus seated themselves beneath a
plane tree and surveyed with delight their romantic
surroundings. It was no wonder Apollo had here
chosen a location for one of his shrines! The very
breeze which brushed against their cheeks was like the
breath of unseen spirits. The leaves of the plane trees
whispered unintelligible secrets and the mountain
stream murmured of mysteries as it moved majestically
onward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>Suddenly the two became aware of a figure seated
near the edge of the fountain nearly within touch of
its cooling spray. It proved upon closer observation
to be that of an old man with wrinkled countenance and
long flowing beard. From under his shaggy brows he
had surveyed the new-comers with searching eyes. His
hands were folded across the head of a knotty walking-stick.
Cimon, the true Greek, to whom goodness and
purity were synonymous with outward beauty, turned
away from the unlovely figure of the old man with an
exclamation of annoyance, signifying that he disliked
having the loveliness of the scene marred by the presence
of the elderly stranger. But Zopyrus was differently
affected by the sight of the aged one. Something
vaguely familiar in the type of features held his
gaze.</p>
<p>The old man continued to survey the two new-comers
with a penetrating gaze till Cimon stood up
abruptly and said to Zopyrus: &ldquo;Our answers must be
ready. Let us return to the rock of the Sibyl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked away from the fountain keeping his
face averted, for he would not deign to glance again
toward the aged stranger. But Zopyrus&rsquo; heart was
filled with pity toward this old man whose eyes like
living coals burned forth their last lustre from the
ashy gray of his withered face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a stranger in Greece?&rdquo; Zopyrus asked
kindly.</p>
<p>The old man gave an affirmative nod and said, his
tones seeming to issue from the recesses of a cavern,
&ldquo;You too, my young friend, are a stranger to Greece,
but not so your companion,&rdquo; with a nod toward Cimon,
who now hesitated to leave the fountain side and
lingered uncertainly to hear the discourse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, father,&rdquo; replied Zopyrus, bestowing
upon him a look of mingled wonder and approbation,
&ldquo;I came over with King Xerxes, but am not intending
to return to Persia. My companion here knows
that though once half a Greek, I am now entirely won
over to the cause of Hellas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is easy to turn over to the victorious side!
Tell me did you fight for Greece before taking this
step?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he did,&rdquo; cried Cimon who could no longer
maintain his attitude of aloofness. &ldquo;Next to Pausanias
himself, there was no braver in the ranks of the
Greeks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger&rsquo;s eyes glowed with enthusiasm and
he bent upon Zopyrus a look of deep admiration. Suddenly
he stood up and though he leaned on his cane,
the young men were surprised at his lofty stature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you intend to worship the gods of Greece? I
see you have made a start by journeying here to this
shrine of pagan idolatry.&rdquo; He looked about him, his
sharp features expressive of scorn and disapproval.</p>
<p>Cimon took an aggressive step toward the two,
but Zopyrus stretched forth his hand deterringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what you mean,&rdquo; Zopyrus asked, a suspicion
of the truth beginning to dawn upon him.</p>
<p>The ancient pilgrim dropped his staff, and raising
his arms toward the heavens, cried, &ldquo;And the Lord
shall be king over all the earth; in that day shall there
be <i>one</i> Lord, and his name <i>one</i>. For the idols have
spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and
have told false dreams; they comfort in vain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>He turned and pointed with one outstretched arm
in the direction of the oracle, and with the other extended
heavenward he continued: &ldquo;Thus saith the
Lord of hosts: &lsquo;In those days it shall come to pass that
ten men shall take hold out of all the languages of the
nation, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is
a Jew, saying, &ldquo;We will go with you; for we have
heard that God is with you.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last words trembled into a silence that neither
of the men dared to break. The awful solemnity and
stern conviction of this prophet of a foreign race filled
them with indescribable fear. They stood in reverent
attitude before this worthy seer whose inspired
words caused the possible utterances of the demented
Pythoness to sink into utter insignificance. When the
young men ventured to look up, the aged one was disappearing
around the edge of the fountain in the opposite
direction from which the two had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; called Zopyrus. &ldquo;Who are
you, worthy sir, who have only strengthened convictions
which I already possessed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prophet smiled and his face seemed alight
with an inner radiance as he replied, &ldquo;They call me
Zechariah.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>Most conspicuous among the few houses left in
the city after the departure of the Persians
was one that stood at no great distance from
the Acropolis. It was a typical home of the upper-class
Athenian citizen. Its narrow stone front with a
massive door and its two closely barred windows at the
second story did not present a very imposing aspect,
but if one desired admittance and felt disposed to make
use of the polished bronze knocker with which the door
was equipped, his impressions of inhospitality were
immediately dispelled by the appearance of a slave
who courteously bade him enter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Looking down a short hallway one beheld an open
court surrounded by a colonnade and in the center of
this court stood an altar to Zeus. It was here on pleasant
days that the family assembled for worship, partook
of its meals, entered into friendly discussions or
played games. The women&rsquo;s apartments were above,
theirs being the barred windows which looked out on
the narrow winding street. The kitchen and servant
quarters occupied the rear, but by far the most interesting
room was that which adjoined the court to the
left; the library. As if by a miracle this room remained
intact. Its shelves were filled with hundreds of rolls of
manuscript, some slightly charred but undamaged by
fire. At intervals about the room, upon marble pedestals
stood statuettes of the muses, for this was the
library of a poet, and could he not thus readily summon
the muse he desired?</p>
<p>If one were able to tell the time of day by the
shadow-pointer in the nearby public square, he would
know that it was shortly past the noon hour. Four
men were seated in the library, three of them young,
the fourth, slightly past middle-age, was the master of
the house, the poet Pasicles.</p>
<p>As he sat facing his friends, surrounded by his
beloved muses and scrolls, he appeared the personification
of dignity and aristocracy. His features were
clearly and delicately cut, his face thin, his forehead
high and intellectual. The folds of a white linen <i>chiton</i>
draped the long lines of his figure. The three younger
men were Cimon, Polygnotus and Zopyrus. The soft
notes of a flute came from the direction of the court.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your young son plays the flute remarkably well.
May I ask who is his teacher?&rdquo; asked Polygnotus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pedagogue, Niceratus, has given Mimnermus
instructions in flute playing. It is an art in which I
wish the lad to become proficient. The B&oelig;otians have
ever excelled with the flute and I would not have
Mimnermus less skilled in the art than his grandfather
for whom he is named.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;In my opinion,&rdquo; said Cimon, &ldquo;a youth can spend
his time more profitably than with music. Think you
that with the Persian expelled, all warfare is past?
Remember Athens is an object of envy to Sparta,
Thebes and Corinth, to say nothing of such islands as
Aegina, Samos and Naxos, and who knows what may
take place when Mimnermus is in his early manhood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe all sciences and arts should form a part
of every man&rsquo;s education,&rdquo; replied the poet quietly,
&ldquo;but to each one should be allowed the privilege to
specialize in that particular phase of culture which is
dearest to his heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cimon laughed good-naturedly. &ldquo;I confess my
tastes are one-sided too, but I truly believe that our
new friend, Zopyrus, is equally skilled with the sword
or the pen. I swear by the gods I never saw mortal
man fight more heroically than he at Plat&aelig;a, and yet
he can recite the works of Homer, Hesiod and Sappho,
and is well acquainted with the histories of Persia,
Babylonia, Assyria and Egypt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; remarked Zopyrus to whom all
eyes were now turned, &ldquo;I admire a specialist and will
say that I hope to cultivate the arts more assiduously.
I do not enjoy fighting, but God has given me a strong
body and I hope the ability to judge correctly between
right and wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pasicles leaned forward in his chair and looked
with peculiar interest at the young stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know the tragedian, Aeschylus?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>Zopyrus replied in the negative, wondering at his
host&rsquo;s question.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your statement that God has given you a strong
body,&rdquo; continued the poet, &ldquo;is a peculiar one. Among
the numerous friends of my profession, Aeschylus
alone speaks frequently of &lsquo;God.&rsquo; Does it not seem
strange that he exalts Zeus so far above the others,
each one of whom has his or her interest in the affairs
of men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No it does not appear strange to me, for I have
often wondered at the petty jealousies existing between
the gods and even between them and mortals,&rdquo; answered
the Persian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Pasicles earnestly, &ldquo;the envy of the
gods is just and divine. Have you never noticed that
if a mortal rises to too great heights here below, some
god will surely cause his downfall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, my friend,&rdquo; said Zopyrus, seriously interested,
&ldquo;is not the envy of the gods, but the natural
result of arrogance and pride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I can well testify,&rdquo; said Cimon sadly, &ldquo;for
was not my father Miltiades, the greatest man in all
Greece after Marathon? And did he not at the very
summit of his glory, stoop to avenge some petty wrong
and thus die an ignoble death? It seems that with complete
success, passes that good judgment which is ever
present as we strive to attain some worthy end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fate of your hapless parent,&rdquo; said Pasicles,
&ldquo;should prove a warning, but alas, man is little content
to profit by the sad experiences of his forefathers.
Each one must learn for himself in the school of life,
and many there be who, in the realization of success,
do not lose their power of judgment, and such as
these are partially rewarded by the gods here on
earth.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of our statesman, Themistocles?&rdquo;
asked Polygnotus. &ldquo;Is he not of the type
likely to lose his head over his popularity, for truly
one must admit his advice about Salamis was a turning
point in our affairs with Persia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In truth,&rdquo; replied Pasicles, &ldquo;I like not this blustering
statesman any too well. My sympathies have
always been with his rival, the just Aristides whose
policies are not for the purpose of display, and whose
reserved manner has won the confidence of the refined,
thinking people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Themistocles has the interest of Athens truly at
heart, and the people have just awakened to a realization
of this,&rdquo; said another voice from the doorway.</p>
<p>Zopyrus looked up and saw a stranger, to him at
least, whose gaze after it had fallen upon each of his
three companions, rested in final friendly curiosity
upon him. His waving hair and short beard of rich
chestnut brown framed a face of surprising manly
beauty, the face of a man about the age of Pasicles. His
forehead was smooth and broad, the brows rather prominent,
the eyes meditative, but containing indications
of a hidden fire which might leap forth were their
owner challenged to uphold a conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome into our midst, Aeschylus,&rdquo; exclaimed
Pasicles rising and extending his hands to the newcomer.
&ldquo;We will not continue to argue about Themistocles
and Aristides as we have been wont to do. You
are acquainted with the soldier and the artist, are you
not, but here is a stranger to you I am sure, Zopyrus
who fought bravely at Plat&aelig;a.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>The tragedian, Aeschylus, crossed the room and
seated himself by the side of Zopyrus, who wondered
at his searching gaze but did not resent it. Above all
things the sincerity of Aeschylus greatly impressed
him. The poet seemed to be one who was forever
searching after truth. Zopyrus regretted that he had
read none of the plays of this great man. He knew that
his fame was due principally to his powers as an advocate
of the truth, painful though that truth might be,
and to the fact that he did not avoid the difficult problems
of life, but faced them with earnest zeal and saw
them through to the finish. Of the mighty and forceful
language which conveyed his ideas, as opposed to
the more elaborate and artificial style of Pasicles,
Zopyrus had heard, and he enjoyed the privilege of
conversing with the great poet.</p>
<p>Two kindred souls had intercourse through the
eyes and the medium of conversation. An attachment
which time would strengthen sprang up between the
young Persian and the older poet, such a friendship
as was not uncommon among the Athenians, where a
man of maturer years lived again in a younger man
the joys and possibilities that might have been his, and
where a youth looked with reverence to an older companion
whom he worshipped as a hero.</p>
<p>Presently Pasicles arose, and leading the way
through the court, bade his guests follow. Soon they
found themselves in a garden, strolling along paths
bordered with trees, flowers and shrubs, opening here
and there to reveal a statue of some sylvan god reclining
under the shade. An aged gardener was tending
the flowers with loving care.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the women, Hagnias?&rdquo; asked Pasicles
as the five men approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under the arbor near the fountain,&rdquo; was the
reply.</p>
<p>It was as Hagnias had said. Upon a stone bench
and a large high-backed stone chair were seated three
women. The woman in the chair arose smilingly when
she beheld the men and approached Pasicles who
pressed an affectionate kiss upon her smooth white
forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cleodice my wife, and my daughters, Eumetis
and Corinna, this is Zopyrus who is to be a guest in
our home for awhile. The others you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The matronly Cleodice heartily bade Zopyrus
welcome and her sentiments were echoed by her daughters.
Corinna who resembled her mother, especially
in the wealth of auburn hair which both possessed acknowledged
the introduction and then made her way to
the other side of the fountain to where Polygnotus
stood gazing into the mirror-like surface, and Zopyrus
as his eyes followed these two, knew that love existed
between them.</p>
<p>The other daughter, Eumetis, who seemed the
feminine counterpart of her father, was her sister&rsquo;s
senior by at least a year. She did not possess the
physical loveliness of Corinna but her plainer features
expressed sincerity and selfishness almost to a fault.
One knew that the plain exterior harbored a soul that
would give and continue to give for the sake of those
she loved. If it is possible to possess selfishness to a
fault it is where one&rsquo;s greatest joy comes from seeing
others happy and this was true of the elder daughter
of the poet. If self is the only prison that can ever confine
the soul, Eumetis was as free as the birds of the
air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;Amid such charming surroundings as these, one
ought never to be sad,&rdquo; said Zopyrus to Eumetis after
the introduction. &ldquo;It seems a miracle that this lovely
home was spared. Do you happen to know why it
escaped pillage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some say,&rdquo; replied the daughter of Pasicles,
&ldquo;that it was spared out of respect to my dear father,
but he modestly refutes this and claims that because
of its size and proximity to the city, it was chosen as
quarters for Persian officers. Even the altar to Zeus
remained unprofaned and the manuscripts, many of
them, were just as my father had left them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although this is indeed a lovely spot, I shall not
test your hospitality to the limit. I intend to help
rebuild Athens, and soon with the combined efforts of
many, there will be homes for all,&rdquo; said Zopyrus smiling
into the girl&rsquo;s serious face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we shall be delighted to
have you with us. My father has spoken very well of
you and says you have offered to copy some of his odes
for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very small payment in return for lodgment
in this miniature paradise,&rdquo; the youth returned
gallantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>Eumetis laughed and blushed. &ldquo;Our paradise on
earth is a good deal what we make it. True joy comes
from within, happiness from without. I have tried to
cultivate the spirit of joy, but believe I have failed
miserably. With Corinna it is different. She is always
gay. Happiness comes to her unasked, so I believe she
has a well of joy within her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man and the girl looked in the direction of
the fountain to where Polygnotus and Corinna sat
together on the edge of the marble basin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Polygnotus has been a caller here for some
time,&rdquo; continued Eumetis. &ldquo;The horrors of recent
events have delayed but not altered his purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could wish your sister no greater happiness,&rdquo;
said Zopyrus, &ldquo;for I admire this artist very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Polygnotus is fortunate indeed in possessing
the love of the girl whom he admires, but his most
intimate friend, Cimon, has not been so successful
where affairs of the heart are concerned. He has not
seen his sweetheart since he returned from Aegina,
and he does not know what fate may have befallen her.
She was not among those who fled to Troezen and
Salamis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is truly most sad,&rdquo; replied Zopyrus with
feeling. &ldquo;It may be that when the city is back again
to its normal condition, she will appear. If she loves
Cimon she will return to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but there lies the difficulty,&rdquo; said Eumetis,
&ldquo;She does not love him. I called her his sweetheart
wrongly, for it is purely a one-sided affair, and I fear
that she will never return. Cimon idolizes her, and
would have made her his wife ere this, but she refused.
Can you think of anything more tragic than unrequited
love?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is most unfortunate, but I believe unusual, for
in my opinion true love has its origin in a mutual attraction,
for we creatures, of dust though we be, are
conceited enough that we love those who love us. There
are exceptions, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eumetis turned away. &ldquo;The exceptions often
prove the rule, and unfortunate are they whose lives
give proof of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They joined the others as did Polygnotus and
Corinna, and all entered the house to partake of refreshments.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Athens, the stately-walled, magnificent!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="lr">Pindar.</p>
</div>
<p>The sun sank in an unclouded blaze, but with the
approach of evening the toilers did not cease.
The builders of the pyramids of Egypt could
boast no greater zeal than that with which the Athenians
fortified their city. Men, women and children,
rich, middle-class and poor worked together for the
attainment of but one end; the erection of a wall about
their city which would protect it from over-ambitious
states and cities. Stones from partly demolished
buildings, broken pieces of statuary, the debris of
structures once the pride of every loyal Athenian,
added bit by bit to the work of defense.</p>
<p>Zopyrus labored near the Diomean Gate lifting
the large stones into places which had been freshly
spread with mortar by the women and children. In
vain his eyes searched the throng for a figure, the
memory of which occupied his thoughts almost constantly
since Salamis. He had worked at different
sections of the wall in the hope that somewhere he
would see her employed in the common task of all,
but though he anxiously scanned a thousand faces during
the course of his labor, hers was not among them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>A young man at his side nudged his elbow. &ldquo;By
tomorrow at this time the wall should be of sufficient
height for Aristides and his companion to leave for
Sparta to join Themistocles who awaits them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zopyrus agreed with the youth&rsquo;s statement and
added, &ldquo;It was a clever scheme of Themistocles to go
to Sparta apparently to argue about the feasibility
of building a wall around Athens, the while he planned
to have all Athenians erect such a wall. By having
Aristides delay in joining him he made it possible for
us to get the wall to a height sufficient for defense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Themistocles is very clever, no doubt,&rdquo; replied
his companion, &ldquo;but the calm judgment of Aristides is
not to be discredited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said Zopyrus, &ldquo;but it is the wit
of Themistocles which will frustrate the ambitions of
Sparta this time. Aristides is like the moon which is
now rising on the other side of the city, as compared
with the sun, Themistocles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment Abronychus, a youth whom Zopyrus
had met after the battle of Plat&aelig;a, approached
the two with a friendly clap upon the shoulder of each.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zopyrus and Lysimachus! I am glad to see you
two together. In my mind I have always associated
you as men of like temperament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Zopyrus jocosely, &ldquo;an argument has
engaged us both up to the present moment. Your
friend puts much confidence in the opinions of Aristides,
while I maintain Themistocles to be the superior
of the two.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>Abronychus&rsquo; smile spread into a broad grin. Turning
to Lysimachus he said, &ldquo;Your father wishes to talk
with you at once. I met him at the shop of Aphobus
where he awaits you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the figure of Lysimachus disappeared in the
crowd Zopyrus remarked, &ldquo;A likely young fellow. I
liked his upright manner, though his opinions differed
from mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His father summons him,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;that
he may bid farewell before leaving in the morning, at
least twelve hours before he expected to make the trip.
You see his father is Aristides who is to join Themistocles
at Sparta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aristides his father!&rdquo; exclaimed the crest-fallen
Zopyrus. &ldquo;Well I like him and hope he will not resent
my remarks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I know Lysimachus,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;he will
take no offense at what you said. I hope you will see
him again. He has worked near the Diomean Gate ever
since the wall was commenced. Your energies have
not been so concentrated, for if I remember correctly,
I have seen you at the gate of Diocharus and upon another
occasion you were unloading stones at the north
of the city beyond the Acharman Gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you the reason for my scattered efforts,
though I maintain I have worked diligently wherever
I happened to be. I began at the east side of the city,
working near the different gates, a half day at a time
and traveling northward. I am searching for a girl
whom I met at the time of the battle of Salamis. I have
not seen her since, and I know not where to find her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her name?&rdquo; inquired Abronychus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;Alas I did not ask it, but her face I can not
forget! Eyes that reflect the heaven&rsquo;s blue, straight
brows, delicately chiseled nose, a mouth that&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abronychus threw up his hands in deprecation.
&ldquo;I have not seen her, or I have seen hundreds of her!
Which shall I say, my friend? I must be going now and
I wish you success in your search for the missing
lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the departure of Abronychus, Zopyrus toiled
lifting rocks and pieces of masonry. It was with a feeling
of ineffable relief that he heard the orders of the
night-guard and saw that others were coming to take
the places of those who had labored since mid-afternoon.
Presently an approaching female figure caught
his eye and in an instant he recognized Ladice whom he
had rescued from the coarse Persian officer. She was
conversing with an older woman and Zopyrus tried to
attract her attention, for from her he hoped to learn
the identity of her companion on the Acropolis. The
tired workers in their eagerness to get to their homes
for rest, pressed between him and Ladice, and he soon
lost sight of her. He was pleased to know that she
had reached Athens in safety, but his heart was filled
with anxiety for the maiden whom he had rescued
on the Acropolis.</p>
<p>As Zopyrus passed the Sacred Gate he glanced
down the broad white road that he had followed the
day he bore in his arms the unconscious Greek girl.
The moon back of him shed its soft ethereal light over
a scene that had recurred to him again and again in
memory. Moved by an unexplainable impulse, he
passed through the city-gate and pursued his course
along the road that stretched luringly into the distance,
bordered by the dusky shadows of olive trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>Scarcely had he proceeded a furlong when he became
aware of a figure several paces ahead. The man,
for so it proved to be, was lost in thought and walked
slowly, his head bent forward in meditation. Zopyrus&rsquo;
first impulse was to return to the city, but something
familiar in the man&rsquo;s dress and figure arrested his
notice, so he carried out his original intention of taking
a moonlight stroll along the Sacred Way. Before
the man turned Zopyrus had recognized the poet
Aeschylus and simultaneously with the recognition
came a feeling of joy that this much revered man could
be his companion upon such an occasion. Aeschylus
recognized the youth as he approached and placed an
arm across his shoulders as together they proceeded
to the northwest.</p>
<p>For some moments only the sound of their sandals
on the stony pavement broke the stillness, but at length
Zopyrus asked: &ldquo;Did this road stretching into the distance
lure you too as you passed the gate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It always entices me, for it is the way to my
home. I live at Eleusis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zopyrus expressed no little surprise, for he had
always thought of Aeschylus as a native of Athens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had planned to move to Athens,&rdquo; continued the
poet, &ldquo;so my elder son could attend the Academy, but
God saw fit to snatch him forever from me in the late
war with the oriental barbarians.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>Aeschylus stood a moment, his head bent forward,
his attitude that of a man in complete subjection to a
master. Zopyrus imagined that his lips moved but
there was no sound forthcoming. Then there came to
the Persian the memory of the maiden&rsquo;s prayer, followed
by the song from a myriad unseen throats, the
mighty p&aelig;an that had saved Greece. Zopyrus as he
watched the poet in silence knew that he too prayed.
When the latter raised his head Zopyrus said tensely:
&ldquo;Your prayer is the second of its kind that I have seen.
It ascends straight to God&mdash;&ldquo;&mdash;then after a moment&rsquo;s
pause, &ldquo;Tell me how do you explain the miracle of
Salamis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aeschylus gazed long and earnestly into the eyes
of the young man before he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a word from the invisible, unapproachable
Spirit of the universe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zopyrus was greatly moved by the poet&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believe that in great crises Zeus will help
those whom He believes to be in the right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I believe that this God must have been
approached by a devout suppliant, and that this was
his answer to an earnest prayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aeschylus,&rdquo; said the young man, and he stood
and faced his companion so that the moon shone full
into his face revealing his emotion, &ldquo;I was myself a
witness, the only one, to the prayer that saved Greece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You a witness to such a prayer!&rdquo; exclaimed the
incredulous poet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>Zopyrus nodded, then as the two resumed their
nocturnal promenade he related to the interested philosopher
in detail, trying not to reveal his identity, the
facts of his meeting with the girl upon whom he had
not laid eyes for a year. After his narration had been
concluded he was conscious of the fixed gaze of his companion
upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zopyrus,&rdquo; said Aeschylus, &ldquo;I have decided to
begin work on a tragedy which will present the Persian
point of view and especially that of the royal family in
this war, I would be very grateful would you acquaint
me with many details of life at Susa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zopyrus was startled. Had his words or manner
of speech betrayed him to the friend whom above all
others he esteemed most highly? It was apparent that
even if Aeschylus did know him to be a Persian
by birth, he was neither rebuking nor condemning him
for that fact, but rather was he mildly assuring him
that his birth need be no detriment to him in his present
surroundings. Zopyrus believed that Aeschylus was
convinced of his sincerity in the present interests of
Greece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be pleased to assist you in your great
work,&rdquo; he replied in a quiet tone. &ldquo;Having spent a
few months out of each year at the Persian court, I
should know something of the Persian view-point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you a servant or a member of the nobility?&rdquo;
questioned the poet quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must I tell you that?&rdquo; asked the younger man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, I am a cousin of king Xerxes. My
father was satrap of Sardis and an own brother of
Darius Hystaspis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older man turned quickly and his brow clouded
as he cried:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by parading in Greek clothes
and looking with love upon a maiden of Hellas? Think
you that a pure lovely girl of our land would return
the affections of a cousin of the profligate Xerxes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zopyrus&rsquo; reply was made with becoming dignity.
&ldquo;I sincerely believe that the girl returns my affections,
and as for my Persian ancestry, what think you of my
features?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aeschylus&rsquo; expression of anger softened as he
looked upon the young man&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is the mystery,&rdquo; he said in a puzzled voice,
&ldquo;I can think of no other than Theseus when I behold
you. Your face is the type that characterizes our
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From my departed mother have I inherited the
features in which you behold a likeness to one of your
national heroes, but not alone in face and form do I
resemble the Greeks, but in nature too am I truly one
of you. My mother was a Greek whose parents were
members of the family of Ceryces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ceryces!&rdquo; exclaimed Aeschylus in surprise.
&ldquo;Outside of the family of Eumolpid&aelig;, I know no better
in all this fair land. I bid you welcome to Greece and
into our midst. I was not mistaken in my first impressions
of you. Will you overlook the hasty words
I spoke a few minutes ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not offended,&rdquo; replied Zopyrus, &ldquo;for I
knew that after mature deliberation you would be convinced
of the reality of my sincerity. My conscience
has been my guide. I have always tried to obey it, thus
keeping it ever sensitive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poet smiled kindly into the earnest young face
flushed with emotion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;Young man, perfection lies in just that,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;keeping the conscience sensitive. If you continue
thus to strive after perfection in your youth you
will be laying up virtues which will serve you in the
crises of life which come later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have often thought,&rdquo; said Zopyrus
puzzled, &ldquo;that sometimes it is very difficult to determine
between virtues and vices. That may sound very
strange to you who consider them to be exactly opposite,
but occasionally even a sensitive conscience can
not discriminate. It seems to me that virtues and vices
are very closely allied. How easy it is for one who is
the very soul of generosity to over-step the bound and
become a spendthrift! Might not one who possessed
the virtue of thrift pass over the hair-breadth boundary
into the vice of miserliness? Might not one of a loving
nature tend toward licentiousness if not watchful,
or one of self-restraint become too cold? Then again
if one is neat and careful about one&rsquo;s personal appearance
might he not become vain if not watchful, or on
the other hand if indifferent to the appearance of his
body because the weightier matters of the soul concerned
him more, might he not have the tendency to
grow filthy and untidy in appearance? So it seems
to me, my good Aeschylus, that it takes a very alert
and sensitive conscience indeed to distinguish between
the so-called virtues and vices, and to pass judgment
correctly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, my boy, it does, and remember
this; that in letting your conscience decide matters,
you must not forget that no man lives unto himself,
for everything he does affects another, but I see you
are tired,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have worked hard at the
wall. In that you have done rightly, for toil is mankind&rsquo;s
greatest boon and life without industry is sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zopyrus glanced toward the sky, &ldquo;The moon is
beginning its descent and I must return to the house
of Pasicles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment before you go,&rdquo; said the poet, laying
a detaining hand upon the other&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;You as a member
of the Ceryces family should be initiated into the
divine mysteries of Eleusis. Had your departed
mother never mentioned them to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a very young child I remember my mother&rsquo;s
having mentioned, upon several occasions when we
were alone, the Eleusinian Mysteries and my childish
mind nourished by an exceptionally vivid imagination,
dwelt a great deal upon the probable nature of these
enigmatical rites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At two months from this time when the moon is
again in its fullness, I will act in the capacity of
mystagogue for you. Till then I will see you occasionally
at Athens in the home of our mutual friend.
May the God who is powerful above all others protect
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words he was gone leaving Zopyrus
puzzled but greatly elated.</p>

<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XV.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">What Happened at the Theatre of Dionysus.</span></h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Forth came, with slow and measured tread,</p>
<p class="t0">The ancient chorus, solemn, dread,</p>
<p class="t0">And through the theatre&rsquo;s ample bound</p>
<p class="t0">Stately they took their wonted round.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="lr">Schiller.</p>
</div>
<p>After the passage of a few weeks, Zopyrus became
convinced of a fact which caused him great
concern. It was the growing love for him which
Eumetis could ill conceal. An alliance with the house
of the aristocratic poet would be an honor. Zopyrus
believed and rightly, that he had found favor with
Pasicles and Cleodice. Still he knew that while he
respected and admired Eumetis for the many desirable
qualities which she possessed, he did not love her as
a man should love the woman whom he chooses out
of all others to be his mate. The cognizance of this
unreturned affection and his inability to rediscover the
maiden who was the object of his love were the only
obstacles which disturbed the course of an otherwise
peaceful existence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>Sparta&rsquo;s pernicious ambitions were timely frustrated
and Athens surrounded by seven miles of solid
masonry and with Themistocles as its temporary idol,
settled down to its pre-war mode of life. In the Agora
the fishmonger&rsquo;s bell announced the opening of fish-market,
artisans went to their trade, the wealthy sought
the shops and other public places or gossiped while
they rested in the comfortable seats in the shady
arcades. But the ordinary routine was frequently interrupted
by judicial duties or public services pertaining
to religious festivals, Olympiads or theatrical performances,
and it was upon the latter occasion that on
this day the crowds were leaving the market-place and
pursuing a westward direction to the theatre of Dionysus
which was an amphitheatre situated on the southern
slope of the Acropolis.</p>
<p>Entrance was procured for the public through
great gates on the right and left which opened into
the orchestra or circular pit where the chorus marched
and sang between the acts. The orchestra was situated
between the stage and the auditorium which had
a seating capacity of thirty thousand. The stone seats
which rose tier upon tier were very wide and actually
consisted of three distinct parts; the first as a seat,
the second as a gangway for those walking, and the
third part was hollowed out a little for the feet of
those sitting above. The whole semi-circular structure
was cut by stairs which like radii divided it into sections
to facilitate the locating of seats. At the top of
each division upon a pedestal stood the bust of some
god or goddess, that of Dionysus occupying the middle
section or place of honor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>Considerably to the right and about half way down
in the section of Aphrodite sat Pasicles, Cleodice,
Polygnotus, Corinna, Zopyrus, Eumetis and the lad
Mimnermus. Bright colored kerchiefs adorned the
heads of the women all over the assemblage, giving a
gala appearance to the scene. At intervals over the
theatre there were raised seats with high ornate backs,
arm-rests and cushions. These were reserved for
judges and officials or for any who were deemed deserving
to occupy them. In one of these seats near the
front of the section of Dionysus sat the tragedian,
Phrynichus, so privileged as the composer of the
tragedy, &ldquo;The Capture of Miletus,&rdquo; which was about
to be enacted. Next to him was seated Aeschylus, his
younger contemporary and staunch admirer.</p>
<p>Above the vast assembly stretched the azure sky
across which an occasional fleecy cloud moved with the
gentle breeze. Behind and above rose the Acropolis
crowned with its marble ruins, and to the front of the
audience, visible in the distance a little to the left of
the stage was clearly discernible the conical outline of
Hymettus, while farther to the east stretched the purple
range of Anchesmus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>In his play, Phrynchius vividly presented to his
spectators, the sad events of the downfall of the beautiful
city of Miletus. He did not hesitate to blame certain
Greek leaders who allowed themselves to be influenced
by secret agents from the enemy, so that many
ships treacherously sailed away at the opening of the
battle. As the play proceeded the poet in gifted
language put into the mouths of his actors, the tragic
tale of the plunder of its dwellings, the conflagration
of its peerless temples and the captivity of its citizens.
There arose in Zopyrus&rsquo; memory the pale, tear-stained
face of his mother when she learned from the lips of
her stern husband, the fate of her native city. Sixteen
years before she had been taken to Sardis as the bride
of the Persian satrap, but she had never forgotten the
city of her birth, nor did she ever recover from the
effect of its sad fate and the probable doom of friends
and relatives. Zopyrus recalled how as a lad of fourteen
he stood beside his mother&rsquo;s death-bed and received
from her lips the request to avenge the destruction
of Miletus. Scalding tears filled his eyes as he
sat with bowed head. Hearing a stifled sob he looked
up and saw that Eumetis was likewise in tears. Thus
encouraged, to discover that he was not alone moved
to tears by the memory of a past tragedy that lived
again before thousands, he scanned the multitude
around him, to learn that many were weeping. Scarcely
was there one who had not lost a loved one, or who
was not in some way painfully reminded of disasters
through conflict with the Persians. In this great common
grief Zopyrus felt himself to be truly one in heart
with the people about him.</p>
<p>While in this mood he felt a light caressing touch
upon his arm, and turning met the eyes of Eumetis
looking up to him with sympathetic understanding, and
in their violet depths he read a truth which, because
he was young and life held for him the possibilities
which it offers to all who are ambitious, flattered while
yet it sincerely pleased him. Before he realized what
he was doing his hand sought hers and held it, delighting
in the thrill of contact.</p>
<p>At the close of the drama a resonant voice from the
stage addressed the throng. It was the ex-archon,
Conon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;Citizens of Athens,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;will you let go
unpunished the offender who has this day moved to
tears, thousands? Is it without complaint that you
listen to words which cause you to live again the
miseries of the past? Has not Greece borne enough
without being thus clearly reminded of past afflictions?
I move you we fine the author one thousand drachmas
as a punishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aeschylus was upon his feet in an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather should our friend here,&rdquo; indicating
Phrynichus, &ldquo;be rewarded the sum of a thousand
drachmas for the skill with which he depicted those
scenes of woe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pay no heed to Aeschylus!&rdquo; cried a voice. &ldquo;He
is a poet who probably entertains like ambitions.
Phrynichus should be fined, not only for his own misdeed,
but as a warning to aspiring poets that we care
not to have presented to us thus our national tragedies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sympathies of the group who were around
Pasicles were with Phrynichus and Aeschylus, and so
likewise were hundreds of others, but the majority
resented the fact that they had been forced to yield
to tears. The motion carried and the tragedian was
forced to pay the penalty inflicted upon him.</p>
<p>As the crowds were leaving the amphitheatre
Zopyrus espied Aeschylus and said as he approached
him: &ldquo;That was a good word you spoke for your
elder friend. Our sympathies were with him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;Phrynichus I believe,&rdquo; answered Aeschylus,
&ldquo;would rather lose the thousand drachmas than have
failed to stir the hearts of the Athenians as he did today.
The light of victory was in his eye, and mark
you, Zopyrus, Conon has not frightened me either, for
I intend to work on my &lsquo;Pers&aelig;&rsquo; with the hope that my
audience too will melt into tears! But I have unpleasant
news for you, my friend. I am leaving soon
for Sicily to visit Hiero, tyrant of Syracuse. My
promise to escort you to the Mysteries will have to
hold over till another year, however you will find in
the most noble Pasicles a worthy mystagogue, and
it is my earnest desire that you become initiated into
the Mysteries at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I not see you again before you leave?&rdquo;
questioned Zopyrus much agitated at the thought of
his friend&rsquo;s imminent departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear not, but time does not drag on the hands
of youth, and,&rdquo; he added with a smile, &ldquo;you may find
the girl of the Acropolis! Farewell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was gone and there seemed a chaos in life
where Aeschylus had once been. The truth-seeking
poet had meant much to him since he had first met
him in the home of Pasicles. He had known personally
many poets and philosophers who in parasitic
fashion drew their nourishment from the court of King
Xerxes. They were neither original in their ideas,
fearing to arouse the wrath of the king by any deviation
from customs, nor were they sincere. Aeschylus
would cater to no man, nor did he bow to public opinion.
The truth clothed in forceful language, was what he
presented to the Athenians, and they could take it or
spurn it as they chose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>The sight of Eumetis waiting for him filled Zopyrus
with a pleasant consciousness that the chaos might
after all be filled with a living, loving personality, and
he hastily joined her. Her slender face, usually
serious, lighted up with joy as she beheld the youth
approaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rest have gone on,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;We must
hasten if we are to overtake them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it necessary that we overtake them?&rdquo; asked
Zopyrus in a voice that sounded unnatural.</p>
<p>Eumetis blushed and shook her head in the negative.
&ldquo;No not if you prefer to delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, Eumetis, for I have something to say to
you.&rdquo; He paused a moment then continued: &ldquo;Will the
daughter of the aristocratic Pasicles deign to look
upon Zopyrus whose origin is to her unknown, as a
suitor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mistaken, Zopyrus, if you think your
parentage is unknown to my father. Aeschylus has
revealed your identity to him, though I know not what
it is and care not as long as Pasicles approves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer Zopyrus drew her arm within his
own and together they crossed the Ceramicus as the
shades of evening were beginning to descend.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">The Celebration of the Mysteries.</span></h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Thence what the lofty grave tragedians taught</p>
<p class="t0">In chorus or iambic, teachers best</p>
<p class="t0">Of moral prudence, with delight received</p>
<p class="t0">In brief sententious precepts, while they treat</p>
<p class="t0">Of fate, and chance, and change in human life.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="lr">John Milton.</p>
</div>
<p>The first rays of sunlight were gilding the pillared
temples of the city as the procession for
the Eleusinian Mysteries filed through the
Dipylon Gate. It was the fifth day of celebration, the
previous four having been spent at Athens in listening
to formal proclamations, taking vows, undergoing purification
and being crowned with garlands as emblems
of initiation. Light were the hearts of the youths
and maidens as with singing and dancing they wended
their way carrying cists containing offerings to Demeter
and Dionysus. At the head of the procession was
carried a statue of the infant Iacchos, a form of
Dionysus.</p>
<p>Many of the female celebrants rode in carriages
as the journey was a long fatiguing one despite the
many stops made. Zopyrus walked beside an open litter
in which sat Cleodice and Eumetis.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;My children,&rdquo; said Cleodice smiling, &ldquo;these
myst&aelig; are celebrating your betrothal though they know
it not! I regret so much that Pasicles was unable to
be with us, but he has invoked the blessing of Hymen
upon you. The nuptials will be solemnized immediately
upon our return from Eleusis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eumetis glanced shyly at the young man who
strode beside the carriage. He had not looked well
lately. There was something drawn and haggard about
his features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear these days of initiation into the Mysteries
are proving too strenuous for you, Zopyrus. You do
not look yourself today,&rdquo; said Eumetis with concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is nothing,&rdquo; replied Zopyrus, &ldquo;but I shall be
glad when these rites are over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For more reasons than one surely,&rdquo; laughed
Cleodice. &ldquo;I remember how impatient your father,&rdquo;
turning to her daughter, &ldquo;was when it was necessary
to wait till the close of the Nemean games to celebrate
our marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>Zopyrus turned to survey the landscape which lay
all green and gold about him. The familiarity of the
scene at this point came to him as a shock. There to
the right lay the olive-grove and there, he could mistake
it not, was the same tree beneath whose gnarled
branches he had laid his precious burden on that day
which would live forever in his memory. Again he
seemed to feel the weight of her unconscious body;
again he observed the beauty, winning seriousness and
refinement of her features and yet once again he
imagined he heard her ask if he were not a disguised
Greek soldier! It was with an effort that he forced
these memories from him. A year had passed and
he would probably never see her again. She must have
perished during the months that followed the battle
of Salamis as many Greeks had. It was folly, he resolved,
to waste one&rsquo;s life in vain regrets. He was
about to take as his wife a chaste girl of excellent parentage,
whose love was wholly his, and he would do
his best to make her happy! As they passed the path
to the southward where he and the maiden had turned
to view the battle from the promontory, he turned his
eyes resolutely to the anxious countenance of Eumetis
and smiled, seeking to forget that which would force
itself uppermost in his consciousness. He partially
succeeded, for the eyes of the maiden, so full of loving
regard, gave him a promise of undying affection. He
placed his hand over hers as it lay on the side of the
carriage, then suddenly he stopped as if struck by an
arrow.</p>
<p>Upon his ears in solemn cadence fell again the
hymn to Dionysus, the p&aelig;an of joy which had miraculously
saved Greece. It was now being sung for
the first time since that memorable event. Every voice
that helped to swell the triumphal song, thrilled with
irrepressible ecstasy. Only in the heart of one did
sadness mingle with joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, Zopyrus? You are ill!
Mother, stop a moment! I can walk as far as the fountain
of Kallichoros while Zopyrus takes my seat in the
carriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zopyrus quickly gained control of his emotions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Foolish girl,&rdquo; he said with mock severity, &ldquo;do
you think I would ride while you walked? I assure
you I am perfectly well. The fountain is just now in
sight where we shall rest and enjoy a little jest and
merry-making.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>The voices and innumerable instruments which
had filled the heavens with harmony ceased their music.
Vast masses of clouds which swept the sky, alternately
unveiled and eclipsed the sun. A crisp breeze
sprang from the sea, so that the myst&aelig; proceeded
along their way after a short stop, desirous of reaching
the Fountain of Kallichoros before the storm which
threatened should break. Their hopes were more than
realized. The sun peeped out from behind a cloud
just as they reached Eleusis by the sea, and shone
directly above the gleaming temple to Demeter. With
its magic rays it lit up the whole sacred precinct. First
were visible the propol&aelig;a and the small temple of
Pluto. To the left was the Telesterion, a large covered
building adjoining which was the sacred temple
to the goddess Demeter, where only those were admitted
who had received full initiation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the sacred temple,&rdquo; whispered Cleodice
who already assumed the office of mystagogue, &ldquo;and
beyond, where you see the waving field of corn, lies the
Rharian Plain where Demeter first sowed corn. Still
farther is the field called Orgas, planted with trees
consecrated to Demeter and Persephone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An official cried in a loud voice, &ldquo;To the sea, ye
Myst&aelig;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must undergo further purification,&rdquo; said
Eumetis, &ldquo;before you can proceed nearer the holy
environs of the temple.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>At this point Cleodice and Eumetis left Zopyrus
who was hurried on with others to the seashore and
into the sea where the final purification took place.
Nearly opposite lay Salamis, the view from this point
differing but little from that which he had obtained
from the promontory nearer Athens.</p>
<p>The sun had set and the stars came out one by
one. As he stood upon the sand and gazed toward
the hazy outline of Salamis, an ecstatic mood took possession
of him. Conscious of his own impotence, he
sank upon his knees and lifted his eyes to the God
who had saved Greece, and who was manifest in all
the wonders of nature around him.</p>
<p>Soon he realized that the other myst&aelig;, bearing
flaming torches, were leaving the shore and repairing
to the temple. As he hurried hither he met Cleodice
with a torch for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to the Telesterion to hear the address
of the hierophant,&rdquo; she explained.</p>
<p>The flickering, reddish lights from hundreds of
torches cast grotesque shadows and produced a weird
effect as they entered the enormous hall and seated
themselves upon the steps which surrounded the square
floor on all sides. Within this square many who had
been in the procession from Athens marched and sang
with the lyre, the flute and the barbiton. Upon their
heads and around their shoulders rested garlands of
interwoven flowers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>The revelry ended at the appearance of four men
from one of the six doors which were arranged in pairs
on three sides of the hall. First in order came the
sacred torch-bearer followed by the altar-priest who
wore the insignia and carried the holy emblems for
the service. Immediately behind him came the hierophant
whose duty it was to expound the truths to the
newly initiated. This man, chosen in the prime of life,
was selected from the aristocratic family of the
Eumolpid&aelig;. His term would last till his death, for
such was the custom regarding the election of this
officer. In his footsteps followed a fourth figure, the
sacred herald, who together with the altar-priest and
torch-bearer, was chosen for life from the sacred family
of Ceryces, the family in which Zopyrus could proudly
claim membership.</p>
<p>A hush fell upon the assembly at the appearance
of these venerable men. The hierophant with outstretched
hands invoked the blessing of the Mother
goddess upon the celebrants. Then in a well modulated
voice he addressed his words to the newly initiated.</p>
<p>Zopyrus sat as one in a trance, for the sentiment
was similar to that of many utterances of his beloved
friend Aeschylus. His thoughts wandered for a
moment to his poet friend and he wondered if he were
faring well on his journey to the island of Sicily. He
was probably at this moment on the surface of the dark
sea searching the far horizon for a first glimpse of fiery
&AElig;tna, a favorite abode of Demeter and her daughter
Persephone! This brought his thoughts back again to
his immediate surroundings and he listened as the
hierophant spoke:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I look upon yonder green fields, I call upon
the faithful to give thanks to Demeter, that is, that
active manifestation of the One through which the corn
attains to its ripe maturity. Whether we view the sun
or the harvest, or contemplate with admiration the
unity and harmony of the visible or invisible world,
still it is always with the Only, the All-embracing One
we have to do, to Whom we ourselves belong as those
of His manifestations in which He places His self-consciousness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;The wonderful miracle of reviving vegetation, of
the grain which dies in the ground and springs anew
to life, illustrates man&rsquo;s longing for a revival of his
own life, and serves as an assurance of his hope of
immortality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many of you sit before me fearful for the morrow,
for you know not in the day or in the night what
course fate has marked out for you. But think you
that any part of the self-consciousness of this omnipotent
God can sink into utter oblivion? I tell you that
death is but a passing out of this life into a larger,
fuller existence like unto the change which takes place
in a kernel of corn when it is planted in the ground.
What change does Demeter work in that corn? What
change will the One accomplish in you? In Demeter
you see explained the mysteries pertaining to the source
of life. In Persephone you behold life itself with its
problems. Their relation to each other is emblematic
of man&rsquo;s resurrection. We are here now to win the
friendship of the Mother and Daughter that we may
procure a blessing at their hands in the next existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hierophant withdrew, and the sacred herald
announced that a mystery play would be enacted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>Aeschylus had hinted to Zopyrus that the celebration
consisted of &ldquo;things said&rdquo; and &ldquo;things done.&rdquo;
The young man&rsquo;s eyes were fixed in eager anticipation
upon the clear space in the center of the Great Hall,
around the sides of which were seated not less than
three thousand spectators. The actors gained access
to the pit by means of trap-doors which opened from
below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first scene,&rdquo; whispered Cleodice, &ldquo;will represent
Persephone and some girl friends picking roses,
lilies and hyacinths in the fields of Enna in Sicily.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Persephone.</span></h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Yonder brook Demeter&rsquo;s tears received,</p>
<p class="t0">That she wept for her Persephone.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="lr">Schiller.</p>
</div>
<p>Scarcely had the words fallen from Cleodice&rsquo;s
lips than there appeared several maidens running,
dancing and pirouetting. They seemed to be so
many sylvan nymphs effusing the spirit of eternal
spring among imaginary wooded hills, beside babbling
brooks and amid fragrant meadows in search of flowers
to wind in their long hair which streamed behind them
or fell about their shoulders as they ran.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one with the richly broidered gown of pure
white is Persephone,&rdquo; explained Eumetis, observing
that Zopyrus&rsquo; eyes were fastened upon that figure.</p>
<p>Seated between Cleodice and Eumetis, Zopyrus
had not withdrawn his gaze from the girl in white, the
Persephone. It was the maiden whom he had rescued
on the Acropolis!</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is very beautiful, is she not, Zopyrus?&rdquo;
questioned Eumetis with pique.</p>
<p>But Zopyrus did not hear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>Happy Persephone! Life that moves along with
nothing to disturb its tranquility! Presently she sees
a flower, a narcissus, fairer and taller than any around
it, but it is far away. She leaves her companions and
runs gayly to pluck it. Her hand is almost upon the
fair blossom when lo! the earth opens at her feet, and
a chariot drawn by two black horses emerges seemingly
from the very bowels of the earth. Within the chariot
stands a dark, somber-visaged man upon whose head
rests a crown with a solitary dull red stone in the
front. This man is Hades,<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> lord of the underworld.
He seizes the hapless Persephone who struggles vainly
for freedom, and placing her beside him in his magnificent
chariot, vanishes with her to the nether regions.</p>
<p>While this scene was being enacted, Zopyrus sat
as one dazed, for in the person of Hades he had recognized
the traitor of Thermopyl&aelig;.</p>
<p>Again the pit is occupied, this time by two female
figures clad in robes of mourning. They are Ceres
and her faithful maid Iambe. Ceres questions every
one they meet in the hope of finding some trace of her
lost daughter, Persephone. Hecate, goddess of night,
is approached with an inquiry regarding the possible
whereabouts of the unfortunate girl, but Night has seen
nothing, only heard the cry of anguish.</p>
<p>During the six months that Persephone dwelt with
Pluto, her husband, the face of nature showed the
withering touch of the mourning goddess. It was for
Helios, the sun god, to reveal where Persephone was
hidden, and during the remainder of the year that
Persephone&rsquo;s abode was with her mother, Ceres&rsquo; magic
influence was made manifest in the growing and maturing
vegetation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>So the mother goddess, Earth, who during her sorrow
had caused all nature to be barren, produced fruit,
flowers and grain in abundance. As her faithful heart
pined for her daughter, Life, so do we mourn the lost
lives of our loved ones until our souls are assured of
their resurrection. So often from the bitterest experiences
of life do the greatest blessings come.</p>
<p>A communion service followed the presentation of
the suffering and rejoicing of Demeter, in which all the
initiates drank of the same cup with the representatives
of the goddesses. These ceremonies appealed to
the eyes and imaginations of the celebrants through a
form of religious mesmerism.</p>
<p>The ceremonies over, the crowds moved slowly out
of the Telesterion. From the entrance to the rock-terrace,
Persephone and Agne, the woman who had
represented Ceres, watched the departing throng.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An appreciative audience, do you not think so,
Persephone?&rdquo; asked the older woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sincerely hope so,&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;My
greatest happiness can come only from successfully
convincing others that there is a future existence for
all who deserve it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;I saw my cousin, Cleodice and her daughter,
Eumetis,&rdquo; said Agne. &ldquo;There was a young man
seated between them, and I believe he must be the one
to whom Eumetis is betrothed. He will find Eumetis
a worthy mate, for a more unselfish girl never lived.
She loved Polygnotus, but when she realized that her
sister, Corinna loved him, she stepped aside and gave
Polygnotus every opportunity to pay court to her sister.
But see who is coming to pay court here, little
Persephone! Behold Pluto is vanished, and in his
stead we see Ephialtes. I was young once, Persephone,
and if I mistake not, your greatest happiness lies with
him, not in revealing a future life to others. Do not
misunderstand me, my dear, your part as Persephone
is a noble one and may be for a year or two yet, but
then younger Persephones will come to the front, and
you do not want to become a Demeter!&rdquo; here Agne
laughed bitterly. &ldquo;I once stood as you now stand and
hesitated between a lover and an ambition,&mdash;and now
I am just Demeter, truly a noble calling, but not life
as it should be. You are life, Persephone! You personify
it! Then live it, and Ephialtes will gladly share
it with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Persephone was amazed at Agne&rsquo;s frank outburst.
She had always known her as a devout, conscientious
woman whose interest in her part of Ceres in the mystery-play
was the obsession of her life. It was now
vividly impressed upon her that Agne had once been
young as she was, that Agne had once loved and been
loved, and now Agne&rsquo;s advice was to make the most of
that love which comes in life&rsquo;s spring-time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I always thought you wanted me to succeed
you some day as Demeter!&rdquo; the girl exclaimed wonderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe some day you can, but live first. Demeter
was a mother, and I believe a real mother will present
the truths of our belief more vividly than can one who
has never known the joys and pangs of motherhood.&rdquo;
With these words Agne left the maiden just as
Ephialtes approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me to the Grotto of Pluto, Persephone,&rdquo;
said Ephialtes. &ldquo;I wish to have a word
with you alone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>The Grotto of Pluto was a half furlong distant
from the Great Hall which the two now left by way
of the rock-terrace. The night breeze from across the
Rharian plain was warm and laden with the odors of
grain fields.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The usual cool sea breeze has deserted us tonight,&rdquo;
remarked Persephone, &ldquo;but I love equally well
that which blows from the land. It seems to bear a
message from others who live in our own fair land
and to unite us by its common touch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love that wind,&rdquo; said Ephialtes, &ldquo;which blows
across the water from strange, unknown lands, bringing
with it a feeling of mystery. It is characteristic, I
suppose, that the woman love her native land and the
familiar haunts of her childhood, but the man longs
to explore the unknown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes I love Greece, Ephialtes, and who would not?
It has the richest pale-blue air, the loveliest mountain
forms and silvery estuaries, sinking far into the heart of
the land!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They arrived, meeting no one, at the entrance of
the Grotto of Pluto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go in,&rdquo; said Ephialtes softly. &ldquo;There is
a new statue of Iacchos I would show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some other time, Ephialtes. There is no one
here. Tell me what you said you wished to tell me
when we were in the Telesterion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ephialtes was keenly disappointed that the girl
would not enter the grotto with him. His impulse was
to carry her bodily there, but he knew her utterances
of remonstrance would attract attention, so he
silently obeyed her wish, feeling impotent rage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;On the second night of the next full moon, there
is to be a festival of Dionysus on the island of Naxos.
Will you go with me, Persephone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was standing before her; he clasped her hand
and gazed pleadingly into her eyes. She hesitated and
turned thoughtfully away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go with you if I may take Agne as chaperone,&rdquo;
she replied.</p>
<p>Ephialtes answered with well concealed irritation:
&ldquo;Very well, if you insist, but surely you do not mistrust
a friend of such long standing as myself, and oh
my dear Persephone, will you not change your answer
to my question which was put to you last when we
drifted together in the barge off of Salamis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My answer is the same, and by the way, have
you found any clue to the identity of the traitor of
Thermopyl&aelig;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man glanced furtively about him and
made answer: &ldquo;Not yet, but you may rest assured I
will find him since my future happiness depends upon
it. Goodbye now, sweet Persephone, till the second
night of the full moon. I shall count the hours as lost
till I see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He strode toward her as though to embrace her,
but warned by her attitude of aloofness, merely imprinted
a kiss upon her hand. He could well afford
to bridle his passions so as not to offend her before
the excursion to Naxos.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVIII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Agne&rsquo;s Advice.</span></h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Could love part thus? was it not well to speak,</p>
<p class="t0">To have spoken once? It could not but be well.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="lr">Tennyson.</p>
</div>
<p>Alone in the darkness outside the cave of Pluto,
the words of Agne kept ringing in Persephone&rsquo;s
ears:&mdash;&ldquo;Live first! A mother will present the
truths more vividly than one who has never known the
joys and pangs of motherhood.&rdquo; Was this longing
which filled her being, love for the man who had just
left her, or was it merely an indefinable desire to fulfill
the requirements of nature in regard to her sex?</p>
<p>A short distance away the massive temple stood
in dim relief against a starry sky. An occasional group
of celebrants passing between it and the silent figure of
the girl, revealed the sacred edifice and its precincts in
the fluctuating lights of their torches. Life to Persephone
had not been unlike that solid masonry, which
had stood since it was built, unaffected by storms without,
but now the flickering lights revealed it in a new
aspect; showed it by the wavering illumination to contain
secret nooks and crannies which had before been
invisible. So had this new emotion lighted Persephone&rsquo;s
soul till it brought into evidence secret
chambers of her being of which she had been heretofore
unconscious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>Once before this yearning had taken possession of
her being&mdash;she blushed with shame to think of it, but
it was when the Persian officer had kissed her, after
they had witnessed together the great battle. Of course
it was wicked, she thought to herself, to think of that
brute who had dared contemptuously to push aside the
first civilities of their acquaintance, and behave in such
a rude manner, for Ephialtes who was a Greek had
never dared&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; she said half aloud, &ldquo;he was probably
killed at Plat&aelig;a and it serves him right&mdash;only&mdash;of
course&mdash;death is a pretty severe penalty just for kissing
a girl, even if one has no right to do it&mdash;no, I hope
he isn&rsquo;t dead. He wasn&rsquo;t as handsome as Ephialtes,
but there was something more courageous and masterful
about him, and his eyes didn&rsquo;t shrink from looking
right into mine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>With her hand upon her breast, her eyes wide
and bright, she said aloud:&mdash;&ldquo;Live first! A mother
will present the truths more vividly than one who has
never known the joys and pangs of motherhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sudden consciousness of someone standing
near, caused her to start violently and stammer in confusion,
as she realized her last thoughts had been
audible. A young man had appeared out of the
shadows.</p>
<p>He came a few steps nearer and said humbly: &ldquo;I
beg your pardon for this intrusion. I came from the
temple to explore the Grotto, then I saw you standing
here, truly a vision to satisfactorily complete this
impressive scene. I stood and watched you. I had no
idea you would think aloud!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>Even in the faint light Persephone had recognized
her rescuer of the Acropolis, and though her heart
quickened its beat and her cheeks flushed, she resented
his having heard her words, and said somewhat
haughtily: &ldquo;I thought all the Persians had left Greece
by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the Persians have,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I am a
Greek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A contemptuous smile curled her lips. &ldquo;It must
be convenient to be able to change one&rsquo;s nationality at
will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her words stung him, but he did not swerve from
his purpose. He took a step closer to her and said
evenly: &ldquo;I have been searching for you ever since the
Persians were defeated at Plat&aelig;a and now I have
found you. Who are you Persephone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not shrink from him at his approach, but
with lips slightly parted and eyes wide with wonder,
gazed steadfastly into his face. As their eyes met, his
features relaxed from their severity, and once again
he felt the same impulse to hold and kiss her as he had
after the miracle of Salamis. All disdain had vanished
from her attitude, and the words he had heard her
speak and the vague yearning which they expressed,
might not he&mdash;? His arms were stretched forth to
take her, his lips eager to meet hers, when the vision
of another face came between; the face of one to whom
he had made a sacred promise of love! Was he weak,
that he could change his nationality and his sweethearts
to accommodate his moods? He backed away, covering
his face with an uplifted arm, and uttered a sob, &ldquo;It is
too late, little girl! Forget that I sought you after the
Mysteries, forget that I love you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>Persephone&rsquo;s lips quivered as she asked faintly:
&ldquo;Why is it too late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not answer, so deep was his emotion. Suddenly
a new thought occurred to him and he asked
roughly, &ldquo;That fellow who played Pluto with you, does
he&mdash;love you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lowered her eyes in embarrassment as she answered,
&ldquo;He has said so&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is enough,&rdquo; Zopyrus interrupted rudely,
&ldquo;had you any&mdash;thought of accepting his attentions?
This may seem rude to you,&rdquo; he added apologetically,
&ldquo;but believe me, my motives are pure in asking you
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Persephone looked shyly into the eyes of the man
whom she now knew she loved more dearly than any
other, and desiring to entice him into an avowed declaration
of his adoration of her, she said demurely: &ldquo;Circumstances
might favor my acceptance of the young
man who played with me as Pluto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zopyrus ground his teeth in secret dismay. He
knew she was innocent of the fact that her would-be-lover
was a traitor, but how could he, Zopyrus, who
was in honor bound to renounce her, reveal her lover&rsquo;s
identity, and bring disappointment to the maiden&rsquo;s
heart whose longings he had heard in her own words
but a short time ago. He could not, he felt, be like the
dog in the manger of which Aesop had written. If he
could not have her, he could not deny her happiness
with another&mdash;but a traitor! Perhaps it was best that
she should know before it was too late. He looked
again into her eyes and opened his mouth to speak,
then with a shrug of despair he turned and left her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>He was gone, and so were all the celebrants bearing
torches. The temple was now an indistinct black
blot against the sky. No cracks and crannies were
revealed by wavering lights! Someone touched her
arm. It was Agne!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you take my advice, dear Persephone?&rdquo;
whispered the woman. &ldquo;Did you decide to live? Did
you accept him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I accept whom?&rdquo; asked Persephone dazedly.
&ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;no&mdash;, I&mdash;that is he is going to take me to
celebrate the festivities at Naxos on the second night
of the full moon. Will you, dear Agne, go with us as
chaperone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agne consented and said, &ldquo;I know he loves you.
He seemed loath to leave you just now. Do not allow
his role as Hades to prejudice you against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Persephone felt relieved, for by Agne&rsquo;s last remark,
she knew that in the dark Agne had mistaken the
stranger for Ephialtes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, Agne, I will live while I am young.
When Ephialtes asks me for an answer at Naxos, I
will accept him.&rdquo; Persephone&rsquo;s voice faltered, and
Agne misunderstood the cause of the quavering tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you, dear girl, all the happiness that
might have been mine, had I chosen differently when I
stood at the forks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was eventide in the Agora. Booths were being
closed for the night while merchants and customers
were preparing to seek the comfort of their homes.
Gradually the streets became quite deserted except for
a few dogs whose opportunity to feast came at the
close of day when some of the refuse from the meat
and vegetable markets lay about the stalls.</p>
<p>Cimon on his way to dine at the home of Pasicles
nearly collided with a figure as he turned the corner
directly in front of the shop of Aphobus, a dealer in
jewelry and vases. After the first moment of surprise
at meeting anyone at this hour he recognized Ephialtes.
With a friendly nod and word of greeting he would
have passed on his way, but Ephialtes called him by
name and indicated that he wished to speak with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear friend Cimon,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;excuse me
if I seem to intrude where your affairs are concerned,
but after having been myself a witness to the evidence
of your great passion for the girl Ladice, I can not but
desire to assist you and I believe I can be of some use
to you in attaining your heart&rsquo;s desire if you will but
listen to me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>Cimon detected the reek of wine upon the breath
of Ephialtes and fought against a desire to give some
plausible excuse and hasten on his way, but the words
of the latter undeniably aroused his curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you aware,&rdquo; continued Ephialtes, glancing
about to make certain they were not heard, &ldquo;that
Ladice is now a ward of the great Themistocles.&rdquo;
Ephialtes laid special emphasis upon the word &ldquo;great&rdquo;
and looked keenly to note the affect of his words upon
his listener.</p>
<p>Cimon made an impatient gesture. &ldquo;Do you think
to make me jealous of a man twice my age who has
a family of ten children, and has probably taken Ladice
under his protection because he was a personal friend
of her brave father who was killed at Salamis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed you misjudge me, my friend,&rdquo; replied
Ephialtes assuming an aggrieved air. &ldquo;I had not
thought of him in the role of lover. But while she is
under the protection of Themistocles her mind must
constantly be impressed by his opinions, and you know,
yourself, that the statesman does not love you nor did
he your father before you. And why, pray tell me,
does Themistocles hate you? Ah, you hesitate because
of personal modesty, but I will tell you why. It is because
you are likely to become his bitter rival. He
sees in you not only qualities which he himself possesses
as a leader, but likewise some that you have
inherited from your brave father. He fears to lose
public favor, and you, would you hesitate to take for
yourself that which he might lose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ephialtes could see that his words had touched
a vulnerable spot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; replied Cimon, &ldquo;that Themistocles
would never consent to my suit, but you forget that
Ladice does not return my affection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Themistocles out of the way your chances
with his ward are far greater,&rdquo; persisted the other.
&ldquo;Now I have a friend by the name of Leobotes who for
personal reasons, dislikes the statesman so much that
he would gladly cause his downfall. Leobotes is endeavoring
to stir up public opinion against Themistocles
and thus bring about the latter&rsquo;s banishment.
With Themistocles out of Greece forever what is to
prevent you from stepping up into his place? And
once there you can see realized your ambitions of
uniting Sparta and the islands with us in an alliance,
and at the head of hosts of faithful followers you can
put down the revolts of our colonies. Do you think that
with you as tyrant of Athens, Ladice would continue to
treat you with disdain? My dear fellow,&rdquo; laughed
Ephialtes clapping him upon the shoulder, &ldquo;she would
gladly forget the disgrace in which your father died
and would be proud to be the chosen bride of the idol
of Athens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cimon&rsquo;s vanity could no longer resist the subtle
power of Ephialtes&rsquo; flattery. In his mind&rsquo;s eye he pictured
himself the envy of all men. He would first win
the favor of the populace by his magnanimity, then he
would rebuild the temples of Athens that had been
destroyed; the Acropolis must have a splendid shrine
to her goddess, and as Ephialtes had said, the city must
be on friendly terms with Sparta. As he realized that
all this which he visioned was possible of achievement
he could scarcely hold himself in restraint. Though it
was already past the dinner hour at the home of the
poet, Cimon continued talking and planning with
Ephialtes, all else forgotten.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me now and I will introduce you to
Leobotes,&rdquo; suggested Ephialtes, and he was amazed at
the readiness with which the other complied.</p>
<p>They threaded their way through the winding
streets which without walks were lined on either side
by the rough masonry of the houses. Since it was past
the hour of the evening meal they met parties of youths
singing and laughing and exchanging coarse jests, all
of which was a painful reminder to Cimon of a period
of his youth, not so long ago, that he would just as
soon forget.</p>
<p>Cimon did not trust Ephialtes, but the well contrived
scheme which the latter laid before him was
irresistible. As they brushed by open doorways, obtaining
brief glimpses of life within or heard occasional
snatches of conversation, an ecstatic mood
possessed Cimon. Might not he some day possess the
power to change the lives of these people and to put
his name upon their lips, his name spoken in praise and
reverence!</p>
<p>As they approached one entrance, a pretty child,
a girl of about ten years, sat upon the doorstep holding
in her arms a very young infant. Cimon paused,
for he was always irresistibly drawn toward children,
and drew aside the shawl which covered the baby&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oho,&rdquo; he laughed bending over the tiny figure,
&ldquo;behold, Ephialtes, a future citizen of Athens, and
who knows,&rdquo; he added meditatively, &ldquo;the possibilities
that lie in that small bundle of life. What is his name,
child?&rdquo; pinching the girl&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;A good name
means a good start in life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s brown eyes flashed proudly. &ldquo;We have
given him a wonderful name. There is no better in
Athens. We call him Themistocles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ephialtes laughed outright and pulled at Cimon&rsquo;s
tunic. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we must hurry on&mdash;to the
business of naming the unborn citizens of Attica.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The house of Leobotes was the last one before the
widening of the street, where four other lanes like the
fingers of a hand united at the palm, and the so-called
&ldquo;palm&rdquo; was a small square beautified by an ornate
drinking place. The two men refreshed themselves at
the well before seeking to gain entrance at the home
of Leobotes. The owner himself answered their knock.</p>
<p>It is a peculiar thing that we are sensitive at times
to the proximity of extremely agreeable or antagonistic
natures, though they be out of range of sight or
hearing. Such a feeling of repellence Cimon possessed
as he stood at the doorway of Leobotes. True
he had never loved Ephialtes any too well, but there
was a subtle charm of manner in the handsome young
Greek that drew his victims toward him, an attraction
that Leobotes with perhaps no baser traits of character,
lacked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>Leobotes was a thin man with a pointed beard of
sandy color and shifty eyes of a nondescript pale blue
variety. His appearance was anything but inspiring,
and Cimon felt his previous aspirations shrivel within
him whenever he tried to meet the evasive glance of
this friend of Ephialtes. Leobotes, as soon as he had
been informed of the reason for the visit, set some
wine before his guests and after taking a draught himself,
rubbed his hands and smacked his lips as he
turned to Cimon, whom he had known by sight as the
son of the hero of Marathon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a patriotic and loyal citizen,&rdquo; he began,
&ldquo;and I believe in promoting that which is for the good
of our beloved city, and I believe equally,&rdquo; he paused
impressively, &ldquo;in doing away with that which is a
menace to Athens. Themistocles is only waiting his
chance to sell our city and the freedom of its inhabitants
to the highest bidder. How do I know? I was
near him at Salamis and I heard the messages he sent
by his slave to the Persian king, to block the Greek
ships up in the bay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible,&rdquo; asked Cimon deeply impressed,
&ldquo;that he sent such word to Xerxes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not only possible,&rdquo; exclaimed Leobotes, &ldquo;it is a
fact. As you know that was done too,&rdquo; he concluded
with an air of satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes it was done,&rdquo; Cimon acknowledged, &ldquo;but we
won, did we not? Terror fell upon the Persians when
they heard the loud chant of battle and the martial
sound of trumpet from the Greek ranks and soon ships,
Persian ships, were colliding, their oars&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know all that,&rdquo; Leobotes interrupted with
impatience, &ldquo;but that was all contrary to the way
Themistocles had planned, and I believe the purpose
of the deed and not the result should be the cause of
punishment to the perpetrator.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;If the truth were sufficient to convict him,&rdquo; said
Cimon, &ldquo;I should agree with you that the motive of an
act is of primal importance, but do you not think banishment
a very severe punishment unless the accusers
can obtain the most convincing evidence against the
accused?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leobotes smiled as he said, &ldquo;You are aware of the
accusations of Medism against Pausanias. The lure of
wealth and an eastern satrapy following his victory at
Plat&aelig;a proved too attractive. Just recently a slave
sent by him with a message to the Persian king was
overcome by curiosity and upon reading the contents
of the missive learned that he was to be put to death
as soon as his message was delivered. So had all
previous messengers between Pausanias and Xerxes
met their fate in order that absolute secrecy might be
maintained. This slave returned to Greece and made
known to the Ephors the treachery of his master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did Pausanias do?&rdquo; asked Ephialtes for
whom the fate of a traitor possessed a peculiar fascination.</p>
<p>Leobotes turned his pale eyes in the questioner&rsquo;s
direction, and to the latter his voice sounded like the
utterance of judgment as he replied: &ldquo;Pausanias fled
just yesterday to a shrine of Poseidon in which place
he feels secure for the present against any violence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All three were silent for a few moments. At length
Cimon asked, &ldquo;Do you believe Themistocles to be implicated
in this plot of Pausanias?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leobotes hesitated before answering. He did not
like the reluctance which Cimon showed in accepting
what he, Leobotes, liked to think of as proof of
Themistocles&rsquo; guilt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; he answered evasively, &ldquo;that
all men who have tasted success in battle and have won
public favor, sooner or later succumb to an insatiable
yearning for worldly riches and glory no matter at
what price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Cimon is very different,&rdquo; said Ephialtes
quickly, fearing that the trend of conversation was
beginning to defeat the purpose for which he had
sought Leobotes&rsquo; help. &ldquo;If Cimon were to succeed
Themistocles as the leading Athenian, he would accept
no bribery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No of course not,&rdquo; agreed the older man, quick
to comprehend the significance of the other&rsquo;s remark.
&ldquo;There are some men whom one knows instinctively
are above such deeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feeling that this was a suitable remark for Cimon
to ponder, he arose and refilled the empty wine goblets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well what do you propose that I should do?&rdquo;
asked Cimon after he had drained his cup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing for the present but talk,&rdquo; answered
Leobotes. &ldquo;You are popular and influential. A word
from you will go twice as far as a lengthy speech from
either Ephialtes or myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think my influence could be felt?&rdquo;
asked Cimon as he arose to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear young man,&rdquo; Leobotes made answer,
and his tone was ingratiating, while at the same time he
turned and gave a knowing nod to Ephialtes, &ldquo;Much
is expected of you as the son of a brave soldier. Your
name is on the tongues of many, and there is only one
man who stands between you and the highest of mortal
attainments. Need I say more?&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>In compliance with a request from the hero of
Salamis, no less a person than Themistocles himself,
Zopyrus betook himself to the home of that
personage. The two had met frequently at public
gatherings, and Zopyrus, influenced by the first words
he had heard fall from the lips of Aeschylus which were
tributes of praise to Themistocles, had since that time
looked upon the actions and utterances of that statesman
with approval.</p>
<p>A servant admitted him and led him through the
reception room to a doorway which opened into a bright
and cheerful solarium. The statist stood with arms
folded and head bent in reverie. Upon hearing a footfall
he turned quickly and greeted Zopyrus with outstretched
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, my young friend,&rdquo; he cried delightedly.
&ldquo;You come at a time when cheerful companionship is
much needed. As if the cares of a nation are not
enough, the gods are giving me more than my share
of personal woe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>Zopyrus seated himself in the sun-lit room and
surveyed the luxuriant growth of potted tropical
plants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One ought never to feel sad here,&rdquo; he remarked,
&ldquo;but tell me what troubles you Themistocles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will first tell you of my political worries, though
perhaps you share the opinion of many of my former
friends, and can anticipate what I am about to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can not know exactly what you wish to say, but
I presume it has to do with the turning of popular
favor against you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is at the bottom of my sorrow. Once&mdash;&rdquo;
here Themistocles&rsquo; voice broke and he could not continue
for a moment, &ldquo;once I was greatly honored and
deservedly, Zopyrus. Do not think me a braggart to
say so&mdash;but you will remember the favors that all
Athens showed me after Salamis. I was and am still
sincere in my hope for the welfare of this most glorious
of cities, but personal enemies have sown the seeds
of mistrust, and now former friends pass me with
averted faces, and many cast glances of distrust. Did
I not thwart the over-ambitious Sparta? Now the populace
begins to clamor for a younger man, which is good
and natural of course, but this young man favors an
alliance with Sparta, and even argues that such a compact
will be to our advantage. This young man, do
you know him?&rdquo; asked Themistocles with fervor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you mean Cimon, the son of Miltiades,
do you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same,&rdquo; cried Themistocles, &ldquo;the son of a
veritable rascal, so what can one expect!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;Personally I admire Cimon,&rdquo; said Zopyrus
quietly. &ldquo;He is a warrior, every inch of him, and I
favor the plan of appointing him successor to Aristides
as commander of the fleet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you too are against me!&rdquo; cried the older
man hotly. &ldquo;I had counted on your friendship as an
unswerving reality, but I realize there is no such
thing as human constancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zopyrus was deeply moved. &ldquo;I do not for one
moment doubt your sincerity in serving Athens, and
at the time of Salamis your policy was a wise one and
saved Greece from a sad fate, but conditions have
changed since Plat&aelig;a.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; asked the statesman leaning toward
his young companion and lowering his tones,
&ldquo;that there were those who doubted me at Salamis
and were ready to believe that my scheme for compelling
the Greeks to fight was an act intended to favor
the enemy? Had the Persians been victorious at the
time my doom would have been sealed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Athens is too severe, too critical,&rdquo; continued
Themistocles, his voice rising in excitement. &ldquo;Because
such men as Miltiades and Pausanias become arrogant
and selfish after Marathon and Plat&aelig;a, they assume
that I must do likewise after Salamis. This Delean
League which is proposed by Cimon would exclude the
Thessalians and Argives, both as you know friendly
to us, and would substitute allies of Sparta. The
national spirit which made the Greeks omnipotent
against the millions of Darius and Xerxes must live
again! Oh, Athens is temporarily blind, blind, and I
am powerless to save her now! You are young, Zopyrus,
will you not fight this confederacy and clear my
name of suspicions of intrigue with Persia? Seek one
Leobotes, an old enemy of my family, and prevent
him from pressing against me the charge of Medism.
Do this, my friend, and anything that is within my
power I will do for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will do what I can,&rdquo; replied Zopyrus earnestly.
Changing the subject he said, &ldquo;You have heard no
doubt, of the fate of Pausanias?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can imagine what it is, but I had not heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was informed before coming here,&rdquo; said Zopyrus,
&ldquo;that starvation in the temple of Poseidon ended
his miserable existence. As you know a wall had been
built around the temple and armed guards stationed
without who watched night and day. Just before the
end came he was brought forth into the open to die
that he might not pollute the temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas poor Pausanias!&rdquo; cried Themistocles, &ldquo;how
relentless are those who think ill of us! You were
guilty of the charge against you, but by the gods I
am not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zopyrus was deeply impressed by the grief of
Themistocles. He put his hand into his tunic and tore
from his throat a talisman that had hung on a slender
chain. Thrusting it into the hand of the amazed
Themistocles he whispered hurriedly, &ldquo;I hope you may
never need it, but should it prove necessary, this will
make you welcome at the court of Xerxes or his successor
either at Persepolis or Susa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Zopyrus finished speaking a light step was
heard in the adjoining room, and a moment later
Ladice entered. Upon observing another person, she
turned and would have withdrawn had not Zopyrus
stepped forward with the words: &ldquo;Ladice have you
so soon forgotten your rescuer?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>The girl hesitated a moment, then her features lit
up with a pleasant smile of recognition. &ldquo;I had forgotten
your name but I have told Themistocles many
times of your bravery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both men gazed with masculine approval into the
smiling gray eyes of the girl that looked out from
beneath a halo of sunshine and copper colored hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Zopyrus is your deliverer!&rdquo; ejaculated Themistocles,
&ldquo;and he is a Persian!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should use the past tense there, my friend,&rdquo;
said Zopyrus with emotion, &ldquo;for I have been an
Athenian loyal and staunch ever since the death of my
friend Masistius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the mention of the Persian&rsquo;s name, Ladice
turned her head away to hide the tears which filled
her eyes. She sat silently while Zopyrus related the
story of his transformation. When he had finished
Themistocles placed his hands upon the youth&rsquo;s
shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are worthy of your Athenian ancestry. If
you can rescue me from a fate as bad in its way as
Ladice&rsquo;s threatened to be, you will be in my opinion,
second only to Zeus himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do all that I can,&rdquo; said the young man
heartily, &ldquo;and will begin with my friend Cimon who
has proved too talkative of late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Zopyrus&rsquo; departure Themistocles turned to
his young ward and placing a hand upon her bright
hair said, &ldquo;It would greatly please me did you find
favor in the eyes of this young Zopyrus.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>Ladice blushed in painful confusion as she replied,
&ldquo;For some time I feel that no one can fill the place
that my brave Persian, Masistius held, besides I have
heard it rumored that Zopyrus is to wed the daughter
of Pasicles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some moments there was silence between them.
Suddenly Themistocles said fiercely, &ldquo;As long as
Cimon stays away from you, I care not to whom your
heart may turn, even were it the son of my hated
rival Aristides!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, for such you have been to me since
Plat&aelig;a,&rdquo; said Ladice, her lips trembling with emotion,
&ldquo;I have wondered if Cimon&rsquo;s animosity toward you
is not aggravated by my coldness to him. Has it not
occurred to you that he may consider that you alone
are responsible for the failure of his suit? If I were
to accept his attentions, is it not likely that he would
discontinue his efforts to turn the Athenians against
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is possible, Ladice,&rdquo; said the statesman
sadly, &ldquo;but I would under no consideration allow you
to sacrifice your happiness for me. You are young,
while I&mdash;perhaps it is better so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl touched the hand of her foster-father with
loving tenderness as she said: &ldquo;But what if I have
found that I do love him, but have hesitated to speak
before, knowing as I do your justified hatred of him!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>The hero of Salamis placed his hand under the
maiden&rsquo;s chin and lifted her face till he could search
the eyes that sought to veil themselves beneath the
sweeping lashes. His look seemed to penetrate the
innermost recesses of her soul. She struggled to free
herself from the gaze that held her, as she cried beseechingly:
&ldquo;Only believe me, Themistocles. Do you
not see that I can marry the man I love and free you
from the terrible disgrace which threatens you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s arms dropped to his sides and his
mighty head sank to his breast. Ladice stepped
away smiling for she knew his attitude was significant
of resignation.</p>

<p class="lr">Tennyson.</p>
</div>
<p>Zopyrus bade Themistocles and Ladice farewell
and turned his footsteps absent-mindedly to the
house of Pasicles. As it was still early in the
afternoon he decided to walk to the Acropolis and view
again the spoils of the late war that were there on
exhibition. Thinking to avoid the busy street that
passes to the front of the Theatre of Dionysus, Zopyrus
sought the shady but unfrequented side of the Acropolis.
He was arrested by the sound of conversation
punctuated with light laughter. Something familiar in
one of the voices caused him to proceed cautiously.</p>
<p>Seated upon a moss-grown ledge, the lofty wall of
the Acropolis covered with creepers forming an artistic
background, sat Corinna, daughter of Pasicles. Zopyrus
gazed in mute astonishment, for this coquettish
maiden seemed a new Corinna and not the sister of the
serious Eumetis, or the betrothed of the artist,
Polygnotus. Leaning against the ledge and gazing up
at the girl with steadfast attention was a florid-faced
young man, a stranger to Zopyrus. The boldness of
his demeanor displeased Zopyrus greatly, and he decided
to remain where he was and investigate the
stranger&rsquo;s intentions to Corinna.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>Covering Corinna&rsquo;s head was a handsome brocaded
scarf. When the girl tossed back her head in laughter,
the scarf slipped off and fell to the ground. The youth
picked it up, shook off the dust and restored it to its
owner. Corinna joyfully received it and warmly
thanked the young man who assured her he would delight
in rendering her a real service some day.</p>
<p>Zopyrus watched the two for some time and was
about to conclude that it was perhaps a harmless flirtation
when the man&rsquo;s face suddenly lost its expression
of gayety and took on a serious aspect, while his eyes
gleamed with a lustful light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My invitation of a few minutes ago was no joke,
Corinna. Will you go with me to Naxos on the second
night of the next full moon? You will be the queen
of all there, you beautiful girl, with your crown of
auburn hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corinna drew away from the too ardent gestures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can not do that. My parents, my sister, yes
and Polygnotus,&rdquo; she added with a blush, &ldquo;would be
horrified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not let them know,&rdquo; persisted the man. &ldquo;Have
you not a sick friend who might be visited that night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maid hesitated. &ldquo;Give me time to think it
over. You say there will be other girls and that the
ceremonies are beautiful?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes indeed,&rdquo; he cried eagerly, laying a hand on
hers, &ldquo;there will be others, but none so lovely as you!
As for the artist, he is too serious to enjoy life. With
him, Corinna, you would soon become an old woman,
but I am different. I enjoy life and I can make you
so happy that the festival of Dionysus will be an event
in your life that you will never forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well I will try to arrange it so I can go. Where
shall I meet you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the harbor of Pir&aelig;us, an hour after sunrise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zopyrus needed to hear no more. He hesitated
between informing the girl&rsquo;s parents of what he had
heard, and on the other hand, saying nothing about it,
but going to Naxos himself, unknown to her, as her
guardian. After debating the problem all the way
home, he decided upon the latter plan as the better, in
that it might spare Pasicles and Cleodice disappointment
and mortification.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>On the day following the events of the preceding
chapter, Cimon was the recipient of a message the purport
of which caused him to doubt the accuracy of his
sight. The note was from Ladice, the ward of Themistocles,
requesting him to meet her in the latter part
of the afternoon at the mossy ledge on the east side of
the Acropolis. Believing that it was all part of a dream
from which he would awaken to miserable reality,
Cimon hurried to his trysting-place with fast beating
heart. His eyesight might still be tricking him, but
there standing by the ledge, her figure draped in a
gown of palest blue that revealed while yet it concealed
the graceful lines of her form, stood Ladice, the one
being who could raise him to the heights of Olympus
or plunge him to the depths of Hades. The desire to
take her in his arms was controlled so that he presented
a calm and dignified exterior as he approached with
the words: &ldquo;I am here in answer to your summons,
Ladice, and I am at your service.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>She raised to his, eyes that betrayed no emotion
either of love or hatred, as she made reply: &ldquo;I am here
simply to say that if you will cease in your attempt
to bring about the ostracism of Themistocles and will
try to undo the evil you have already committed, I
will become your wife, otherwise my former decision
concerning a marriage between us remains
unchanged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cimon could no longer doubt the truth of his
senses. This lovely maiden whom he adored was offering
herself to him, body and soul, but in return for
what? Ah yes, if he would discontinue his efforts to
banish the one man who stood between him and the
pinnacle of fame and fortune which had but recently
appeared above him as possible of access. He looked
about him wildly, while for a moment his mind seemed
a chaos. Athens or Ladice, a city or a maid, fame or
marital bliss! He could feel the blood throbbing at his
temples while it seemed an eternity before he could
speak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>Around him lay the city that he loved, the city
for which his father had fought and died, the home of
his youth and the shelter of his maturing ambitions.
Before him stood a maiden in an attempt to rescue
whom, a friend had forfeited his life. Revenge toward
her because he had failed to awaken in her heart the
love for which he yearned, had caused him to first listen
to the words of Ephialtes. Later had come the other
ambition. With a cry that expressed a realization of
freedom after long confinement, Cimon stepped forward
and took the impassive form of Ladice in his
arms.</p>

<p>Ever since Zopyrus had seen again the girl whom
he had rescued from the Persian soldiery, he
could think of little else. She filled his conscious
thoughts and at night he dreamed of her, but
he had made up his mind with stern resolution that
he would be true to his promise to Eumetis who seemed
to love him devotedly. The wedding had been postponed
from the end of the Mystery celebrations to
the third night of the full moon.</p>
<p>An idea came to Zopyrus while he was in the
library copying manuscripts for Pasicles the afternoon
following his eavesdropping near the Acropolis. If the
marriage ceremonies were celebrated one night before,
that is on the second night of the full moon, Corinna
could not go to Naxos with the stranger, for she would
be obliged to attend the nuptials of her sister. The
idea had just impressed him as the best way to save
Corinna, when Pasicles entered the library and placed
in Zopyrus&rsquo; hands a missive, bearing upon its exterior
the stamp of Hiero, tyrant of Syracuse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; cried the young man with delight,
&ldquo;this letter is from Aeschylus! Will you not seat
yourself and hear it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; replied Pasicles, &ldquo;I came only to deliver
the letter into your hands and to tell you that
the writing of an ode for the recent victor of the
Nemean games, takes me immediately to Argolis and
I can not possibly be back until the day of yours and
Eumetis&rsquo; marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Zopyrus with unconcealed dismay,
&ldquo;can you not come the day before, as I wish to put the
date one day ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pasicles attributed Zopyrus&rsquo; disappointment to
impatience for the approaching marriage to take place,
and laying a fatherly hand on his shoulder smiled as
he said: &ldquo;One day is short compared to eternity, my
boy, and I shall have to hasten back to get here on the
third night of the full moon. Farewell and give my
regards to my brother poet when you write.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day!&rdquo; thought Zopyrus, &ldquo;yes, it is short
compared to eternity, but sometimes one day will determine
how we spend eternity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fingered absent-mindedly the parchment which
Pasicles had brought him, then broke the seal and read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Zopyrus at the house of the poet Pasicles in
Athens, greetings from Aeschylus at the court of Hiero
at Syracuse:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have been in my thoughts much of the time
since I left our fair land. I have wondered how you
fared at the Mysteries and if in the joys and sorrows
of Ceres and Persephone, you recognized life&rsquo;s pleasures
and tragedies. Happy is he who has seen these
things and then goes beneath the earth, for he knows
the end of life and its God-given beginning. Remember,
my son, that death is no ill for mortals, but rather a
good. Ceres, Persephone, Ares, Athena, Aphrodite,
Hera, Hermes and all the others are merely personifications
of the various aspects of divine truth and
goodness which are in reality embodied in one supreme
Being of whom every star of heaven, every wave of
ocean, every leaf of the forest, every blade in the
meadow, every rock on the shore, every grain of sand
in the desert, is a manifestation. But I will not bore
you with a rehearsal of my beliefs, for we shall have
glorious opportunities when I return to Greece to discuss
these things at length.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;In company with the most noble Pindar whose
lofty and dignified odes have won him considerable
fame, and the venerable poet, Phrynichus and Simonides,
whose poem exalting the battle of Marathon took
first place over mine, and the nephew of Simonides,
Bacchylides and others, I crossed the Isthmus of
Corinth where a merchant vessel awaited us in the gulf.
There was little to break the monotony of our trip
through the gulf of Corinth. We skirted the northern
coast of Achaia, stopping at Patr&aelig;<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> for more food.
At noon of the third day we passed between the islands
of Cephallenia and Zacynthus, and from then on for
many days only the vault of the heavens and the blue
expanse of the Ionian Sea met our gaze. Imagine then
with what delight we first beheld the misty contours
of land! It was not Sicily which lay before us, but the
Southern end of the Italian peninsula. We got no
nearer than to behold it as a long line of purple clouds,
but bore on to the southward until in the glow of a
magnificent sunset, Mt. &AElig;tna like a giant clad in crimson
and gold seemed to guard the glorious panorama
before us. Never, my friend, have I been so impressed
with the grandeur of nature, and so it was with my
friends! We stood in awe together and watched the
volcano grow gradually larger and more distinct till
we could discern the little homes clustered about its
sloping base, each with its patchwork of vegetable gardens
about it. Above these, groves of olive trees, their
grotesque trunks entwined with grape-vines, flourished
to add their supply of olives, oil and wine to the rich
exports of this island. Lifting our eyes still higher
we beheld another zone of vegetation, as beautiful in
its way as the lower ones. This wooded belt was
densely covered with evergreen pines, birchwoods,
oaks, red beeches and chestnuts, and was a veritable
forest primeval. As the forest ascended the hillside
it grew thinner and more stunted in appearance till
only low shrubs marked its upper boundary, beyond
which was barren rock, and then as if &AElig;tna hoped to
leave a favorable lasting impression, its snow-crowned
summit stood out in dazzling relief against the roseate
sky which marked a dying day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was truly a wonderful first impression of
Sicily, but it was with no less degree of delight that
we passed around the little island of Ortygia the next
day, and saw for the first time the gleaming white
buildings and green parkways of Syracuse. Pindar
called it the fairest of mortal cities.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;We were warmly welcomed by Hiero, whose chief
avocation is the patronizing of the arts of which music,
sculpture and painting are as highly favored as poetry.
He spares no effort to make us feel that we are at
liberty to discuss pro and con any subject that may
arise. So we often sit warm evenings in the garden
of the palace about the silvery-sprayed fountain and
listen or give voice to various opinions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been our pleasure to visit the temple of
Arethusa on the island of Ortygia, where it is said the
nymph for whose worship the fane was erected, was
changed to a spring to escape the unwelcome attentions
of the river-god Alpheus who had pursued her
as she fled underground from Sicily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The city of Himera demanded some of our interest
and attention since it was the recent scene of
conflict and bloodshed. Hiero tells me that the
Carthaginians under the leadership of Hamilcar were
routed by the stratagem of Gelon, brother of Hiero and
tyrant of Syracuse before him, on the same day that
the battle of Salamis was fought. You were no doubt
so interested in the affairs of Greece that the fate of
her colonies was of minor importance. This was true
in my case, but I have since learned that Terillus, governor
of Himera, had been expelled by Theron, despot
of Agrigentum, a flourishing city on the west coast.
In a spirit of revenge, Terillus summoned the Phoenicians
to attack Himera, but Gelon, hearing that the
Carthaginians had been assured of aid by a certain
traitorous Greek, sent a body of his own men to the
Carthaginians as if they were the promised help. This
band of Greeks turned on the Phoenicians and held
them at bay till others rushed in and the city was saved.
In this conflict Hamilcar was killed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;To the south lies a city that I love; Gela, named
for the brave Gelon. The fields of grain and the groves
by which it is surrounded were presumably the original
haunts of Ceres and Persephone. It is here that I wish
my earthly body to be laid at rest when the spirit
has fled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of affairs at Athens? We hear that the
shrine of Apollo at Delos is the center of the new confederacy.
I predict that Cimon will come to be a
great representative of Hellenic unity and he will
accomplish much through this Delian League. All this
will be in opposition to Themistocles&rsquo; opinions, but
Themistocles has had his day and must step aside for
those who are younger in years and newer in ideas.
I sincerely hope there is no truth in the rumor that
Themistocles may be ostracized. Say a good word for
him, Zopyrus, even if your views differ from his.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of one thing more I wish to speak before I conclude
this letter, and that is of my son, Euphorion, at
Eleusis. You remember I told you I lost a son at
Thermopyl&aelig;, but I did not tell you of my other son
two years his brother&rsquo;s junior. It would please me
greatly to have you call and see him. I have told him
of you. You will have much in common, for the lad
shows the same love of poetry and philosophy that I
do, and has vowed from babyhood that he will follow
his father&rsquo;s profession. I know you would enjoy such
a visit to Eleusis especially since your initiation into
the Mysteries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember me to the noble Pasicles and his
family. The length of our sojourn in Sicily has not
been decided, and I shall probably write you again
before I leave. If you find time I shall be interested
in hearing from you in regard to yourself and also
affairs of state. May the blessing of the One rest
upon you.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="verse">

</div>
<p>The sun was scarcely an hour above the horizon
when seven skiffs in festive regalia left the harbor
of Pir&aelig;us southward bound. Six of them were
filled with youths and maidens bedecked with flowers.
Across the serene blue where scarcely a ripple was perceptible,
the voices of the merry-makers floated, returning
in echoes from the temples of marble, gleaming
white on the naked promontories. The seventh boat
was laden with goats intended as sacrificial offerings
to the god Dionysus at his temple on the island of
Naxos.</p>
<p>Ephialtes and Persephone, accompanied by Agne,
whom Persephone has insisted upon taking as chaperone,
were seated in the foremost vessel. Persephone
sat at the prow gazing out across the waters. Her
tunic and skirt were of pale blue trimmed with golden
brocade of an intricate pattern. Her brown-gold hair
lay in waves over her temples which were encircled by
a plain gold band from which hung a chaplet of
sapphires, lying on her forehead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>To Ephialtes she had never appeared more beautiful.
He thought of the evening that they had glided
in this manner off Salamis. He intended to ask her
the same question, hoping she had long since forgotten
the request she had made of him. He turned frequently
with ill-concealed annoyance toward Agne who
sat at Persephone&rsquo;s left. Ephialtes felt that now as
in the Mystery drama they were Hades, Ceres and
Persephone; that Ceres strove to keep her daughter
under her protection, and like Hades he desired to
snatch her from the maternal arms and keep her for his
own. He did not know that Agne&rsquo;s advice had been
favorable to his suit. Had he been acquainted with
this fact he might have been more tolerant of the older
woman.</p>
<p>As the afternoon wore on, a light breeze stirred
the waters into wavelets which gently lapped the shores
of various islands of the Cyclades which they passed;
islands filled with sanctuaries and fanes of white
marble which gleamed ghost-like in the gathering dusk.
At length the moon loomed colossal beyond the island
of Paros, throwing up contours into misty and spectral
relief, and softening all things with its touch of silver.</p>
<p>The festive boats passed Paros, with its temple to
Poseidon, the occupants gazing ahead in eager anticipation
till the rocky promontories of Naxos arose
darkly from the pathway of phosphorescence, then with
one impulse from every throat burst the hymn to
Dionysus. Nearer and nearer came the celebrants,
loftier grew the cliffs of the island and louder echoed
the p&aelig;an until at last the boats drew up one by one
in a sheltered cove.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>Dense foliage grew close to the steep pathway, the
ascent of which was facilitated by steps cut in the soil
or formed naturally by the exposed roots of trees.
Through the branches the newcomers could see the
lights, twinkling as people passed to and fro&mdash;then the
white columns and the pleasing proportions of the
temple came into view.</p>
<p>Persephone, Ephialtes and Agne were the first
arrivals of the first boat, and made their way unhindered
to the temple which they entered, mingling
with the delirious throng whose acclamations rang
through the great hall. It seemed to the arrivals from
Athens that every inhabitant of Naxos was here celebrating.</p>
<p>A great gong silenced the sound of talking and
laughter after all the Athenians had arrived. A curtain
at the end of the <i>cella</i> dropped revealing the image
of the god of wine and revelry and immediately a
hymn of praise was sung following which the sacrifice
of a goat was consummated at the feet of the idol.</p>
<p>Night was turned into day, wine flowed freely and
many a youth&rsquo;s spirits rose in proportion to the amount
of wine he imbibed. To all this revelry Persephone and
Agne were horrified witnesses. They had heard that
Dionysus was worshipped with much rejoicing, especially
at his temple at Naxos, but they had not had
occasion to realize to what depths his worshippers
sometimes fell. The two women looked furtively about
seeking some way in which they might escape unobserved
to the boats where for a few drachmas a
couple of rowers would take them back to the mainland.
They crouched near a pillar watching with increasing
terror, wine-filled creatures who caroused around them.
Many a youth lounged upon a couch or the flower-strewn
floor, his head in some fair one&rsquo;s lap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>Ephialtes made his way with unsteady step to
where the two women cowered. The Greek blood which
ran in his veins preserved his grace even in drunkenness.
Laughingly he held toward each a goblet of
sparkling wine which they declined. In provocation
he accidentally spilled the contents of the cup proffered
to Persephone. For an instant he stood dismayed
watching the blood-like liquid as it flowed over the
marble floor, then with frenzied determination, he
forced between the lips of Agne the wine contained in
the other goblet, after which he stood swaying unsteadily
with folded arms, a sinister smile curling his
handsome lips. Persephone determined to flee but she
did not want to leave Agne at the mercies of the
drunken brutes around them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, Agne,&rdquo; she whispered wildly, &ldquo;You
and I never dreamed what would be the nature of this
celebration&mdash;oh, Agne!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older woman made an attempt to answer and
even to rise to her feet, but in vain! In another instant
she sank in a pitiful heap, apparently lifeless. Persephone&rsquo;s
temples throbbed with angry passion as she
turned toward Ephialtes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a narcotic in that wine! I am glad
mine was spilled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no drug in yours, Persephone. I did
not bring you here to put you to sleep. It is a living
maiden I want!&rdquo; cried the young Greek passionately.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>He lurched toward her to take her in his arms,
but she eluded his grasp and he found himself embracing
the fluted pillar near which she had sat. A chance
observer roared with laughter, and calling to his companions
cried, &ldquo;A king of revelers here, my friends.
What say you to crowning him as Bacchus? Down with
the god of stone and up with one of flesh and blood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying he and his male companions ran to the
throne where the stone Dionysus sat. With unnatural
strength due to the freeness of their imbibing, they
tore the god from his throne and forced the half reluctant
Ephialtes upon it. The wreath of grape leaves
which had adorned the head of Dionysus, was rudely
snatched from it and placed upon the young man&rsquo;s
curls.</p>
<p>After Ephialtes was ceremoniously enthroned,
someone cried out, &ldquo;where is Ariadne? Bacchus must
have his Ariadne! Where did she go? Bring her
back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This appeal was answered by a rapturous shout,
and several youths started in pursuit, returning
shortly, dragging Persephone with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bacchus shows good taste,&rdquo; cried one. &ldquo;She is
surely a rival of the maiden whom Theseus deserted on
these very shores!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up with her,&rdquo; cried another, &ldquo;she must occupy
the throne with him. She shall be his queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That she shall!&rdquo; cried Ephialtes, his courage returning
as he beheld the beautiful frightened face of
the girl whom he loved.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>He stooped from the throne and lifted in his arms
the form of the now unconscious girl. Across her
marble-white forehead strands of loosened hair
streamed. The soft blue light from the circlet of
sapphires which lay on her cold brow, contrasted
strangely with the ruddy brilliance of a ruby clasp
which adorned the hair of Ephialtes above his passion-flushed
countenance. He received a goblet of wine
which had been proffered to him and put it to the lips
of the fainting maiden. The draught brought her back
to consciousness, and she gazed dazedly about, then
suddenly the horror of her situation came upon her.
With an agonized cry she rose to flee but was seized
roughly by Ephialtes who, impassioned, leaned over
her, covering her face and throat with burning kisses.</p>

<p>The second day of the full moon arrived. All
necessary preparations had been made for the
marriage ceremony of Eumetis and Zopyrus
which would take place on the following day.</p>
<p>Corinna approached her mother as the latter stood
near the altar of Zeus, in conversation with the prospective
bride and bridegroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;I have just learned that
my dear friend Gorgo is ill and wishes me to go immediately
and spend the night with her. I will be back
for the wedding tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cleodice&rsquo;s eyes shone with maternal approval as
she surveyed the eager, youthful face so like her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will Polygnotus say?&rdquo; asked Eumetis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh he will recover from the effects of one evening
spent outside of my presence,&rdquo; replied her sister
indifferently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>Zopyrus stood silently by. He had been grievously
disappointed and shocked at Corinna&rsquo;s duplicity, and
had hoped that before the fateful day arrived she would
repent of her former decision and abandon the proposed
trip to Naxos with the stranger. However her
present conversation with Cleodice assured him that
she hung tenaciously to her original purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means spend the night with your sick
friend, Corinna,&rdquo; said a voice from the entryway, and
turning the four beheld the young artist who had
heard the conversation unobserved by the others.</p>
<p>Zopyrus greeted Polygnotus heartily. He thought
at first to apprise him secretly of Corinna&rsquo;s proposed
trip to Naxos, but upon second thought he decided that
there might be a better way of preventing the girl from
committing such a folly without grieving her lover.
The deep sincere eyes of the artist rested a moment in
loving regard upon the face of Corinna who flushed
deeply, turning demurely away. Her mother and sister
each placed an arm lovingly about her, and the
three women left the atrium.</p>
<p>When they were gone Polygnotus turned enthusiastically
to Zopyrus and said: &ldquo;I have good news!
Cimon has just been made commander of the fleet, and
is contemplating visiting Sparta with Alcm&aelig;on in behalf
of the alleged confederacy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your news is pleasing to my ear, and I rejoice
with you and Cimon&mdash;but,&rdquo; Zopyrus glanced about
and lowered his voice to a whisper. &ldquo;Will you not
speak well to Cimon of Themistocles and ask him to do
his utmost to put down this charge of Medism against
the statesman?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will do what I can,&rdquo; replied Polygnotus.
&ldquo;Cimon is more a warrior than a statesman. His
methods are direct and bold, often sadly lacking in
diplomacy. He believes that when a man has served
his purpose in life and is no longer useful to the community
in which he dwells and may even become a
detriment to those whom he once served, he should be
cast aside as one would shed a worn garment when its
season of beauty and service is past. Cimon and
others like him also believe that when maturity of age
is passed and the power of decision begins to wane, the
very burden of long experience perplexes the mind and
engenders doubt and fear instead of confidence. Will
you come with me this evening to the home of Cimon
to congratulate him upon his success and to speak a
good word for Themistocles? But I had forgotten&mdash;tomorrow
you will wed, and possibly you have arrangements
to make in regard to the ceremonies.
Corinna and I are to follow your example before long,
but Cleodice does not wish to lose two daughters at
once, and Eumetis is the older.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am delighted to hear that your marriage will
take place soon. I must be going now as I have a duty
to fulfill,&rdquo; said Zopyrus as he turned to go.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Not long after this conversation a chance observer
might have seen a young man of aristocratic bearing,
crisp blond curls and noble face, walking with elastic
strides toward Pir&aelig;us. He was clad in the short dress
of a laborer, called an <i>exomis</i>, and upon his head was
a narrow-brimmed, close-fitting cap. As he neared the
harbor he proceeded cautiously, desirous of observing
all that was taking place without being seen. To his
consternation he saw that three boats with their occupants
had already been launched upon the sea. Vexed
with himself for having arrived so late he scanned the
people who remained upon the shore waiting to be
assigned to other boats. It was almost unbelievable
but it was true! The sun unmistakably revealed a head
of auburn hair and close to it the bullet-head and thick
florid neck of a young man. Zopyrus, for it was he
who clad in the woolen <i>exomis</i> instead of his customary
linen <i>chiton</i>, watched the two closely, pulled the brim
of his cap well over his eyes and approached the waiting
youths and maidens. Several he recognized as the
sons and daughters of prominent Athenians. Another
filled boat was leaving, the rowers diligently plying the
oars. It was apparent that Corinna and the heavy-set
youth would be of the number to fill the next boat.
Disguising his walk, Zopyrus made his way quickly to
the waiting skiff and approached one of the oarsmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten drachmas for you if you will let me take
your place at the oars,&rdquo; he said in a low tone.</p>
<p>The fellow looked amazed, prepared to turn his
back upon Zopyrus, then suddenly thought better of
the offer. He put forth his hand and when to his surprise
the coins fell into his upturned palm, he sprang
free of his seat and ran to the shore leaving his place
at the oars free to the generous stranger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>Zopyrus took the vacant place and had not long
to wait before the young people filled the waiting boat.
In unison with his fellow oarsmen, Zopyrus assailed the
task briskly, and soon the graceful little skiff was well
out into the harbor. The first boat was a mere speck
near the horizon to the south as the one in which
Corinna was a passenger, emerged from the entrance
of the harbor. Zopyrus was grateful for the opportunity
for strenuous physical exercise. It took his
mind off of his own sorrow. He realized presently that
he was listening unconsciously to the conversation of
two men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say were the names of the seven
boats that left for Naxos?&rdquo; asked one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are named for seven goddesses or nymphs,&rdquo;
replied the other, &ldquo;Doris, Leucothea, Metis, Aegle,
Amphitrite, Doto and Persephone. This one is the
&lsquo;Persephone.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zopyrus let his oars drift when he heard the last
statement. Was the vision or name of Persephone to
haunt him throughout life? When he was on land the
leaves on the trees seemed to whisper &ldquo;Persephone,&rdquo;
and now on the water, the boat in which he sat bore
her name, and the ripples that washed its sides murmured
the beloved accents.</p>
<p>The afternoon wore on, the sun&rsquo;s rays became
more slanting and the boats glided across the water
like silent spirits. At length night descended upon the
water&mdash;but no, it was growing brighter. Where but
a few moments before the hills of distant Paros had
slept on the edge of the darkness, now curve on curve
was silhouetted against the silvery light of the moon,
and the ripple of the oars on the water made a sheet
of phosphorescence in its shadowy depths.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>When Paros was passed, from across the water
there floated on the gentle breeze the Dionysian hymn,
sung by the occupants of the four preceding boats.
Those in the &ldquo;Persephone&rdquo; joined in the chant, and
Zopyrus heard Corinna&rsquo;s pure, soft tones mingling
strangely with the harsh notes of her companion.</p>
<p>As the prow touched the bank Zopyrus sprang
from his seat eager to set foot on land, but he was
checked by the glances of indignant remonstrance cast
upon him not only by his fellow oarsmen, but by the
others as well. He turned his face quickly into the
shadow fearing to be recognized by some of the youths
and maidens of Athens, but his fears proved groundless.
After the boat had been emptied of the Bacchanalians,
Zopyrus quietly stepped ashore, sauntering
leisurely till beyond the range of vision of the oarsmen,
who if they intended observing the rites of Bacchus,
preferred to bide their time. Once out of their sight
and hearing, Zopyrus quickened his pace, keeping well
protected by the bushes and tree-trunks that lined the
path, till he paused in awe as there appeared in a clearing
to the left before him, the white Ionic columns and
chaste lines of the Temple to Dionysus. Alas that its
spotless purity was defiled by the wild orgies within!
Its portals were thronged with gay devotees, and the
sound of laughter and singing blended with the tones
of flute and barbiton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>By now, indifferent to his plebeian dress, Zopyrus
traversed the moon-lit sward to the temple and mingled
with the light-hearted revelers. Groups of celebrants
raised their voices in jubilant song, but here and there
detached couples, their faces stamped with passion and
lust, made horrible the scene. Now and then a <i>hetera</i>
with appealing glance passed close to where Zopyrus
stood like a statue, too horrified too move. The muscles
of his mouth were drawn and his face was haggard.
He suffered complete inertia till the sight of a girl who
reminded him of Corinna aroused him from his
lethargic state and he set out to find her before it was
too late, for he knew that she had been ignorant of the
nature of the revelries.</p>
<p>He pressed on down the length of the <i>cella</i>, scrutinizing
the face of every maiden, but he did not see
Corinna. As he neared the throne of Dionysus, the
sound of triumphant acclamations, poured from the
throats of a hundred devotees and Bacchantes who
stood about the throne, fell upon his ears. He pushed
his way nearer to the front, receiving many rebuffs and
scornful glances because of his mean attire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the excitement?&rdquo; he asked of a young
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can see for yourself,&rdquo; was the surly reply.
&ldquo;Dionysus has turned to flesh and blood and shares
the throne with Ariadne!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zopyrus forced his way onward till he could see
the throne. He stood a moment as if petrified, then
with a few swift strides he was alone before the royal
seat, gazing with death-white countenance at Dionysus
and Ariadne.</p>

</div>
<p>Zopyrus stood with arms folded, his noble head,
perfect stature and dignified bearing appearing
most incongruous with the <i>exomis</i> he wore.
From across his folded arms he looked straight at the
mortal Dionysus, till the latter, feeling his impelling
gaze, looked up and flushed guiltily, though the man
who surveyed him so coldly was to him a total stranger.
Zopyrus walked to the throne, thrust the false Dionysus
rudely aside, seized the amazed Persephone in his arms
and tried to force his way through the crowd with her,
but the indignant remonstrances of the crowd made
futile his efforts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down with him for violating the privileges of the
god!&rdquo; cried one.</p>
<p>This outburst was followed with vociferous cries
of, &ldquo;Take Ariadne from him!&rdquo; &ldquo;Throw him out!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Beat him!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>By this time Ephialtes had recovered his composure.
The appearance of the stranger had inexplicably
discomposed him and the attack had roused
his ire, but now conscious of his costly garb in contrast
to his assailant&rsquo;s attire, he stood before the
throne and in imperious tones demanded the return of
Ariadne, as he called her.</p>
<p>Zopyrus released the girl from his embrace and
asked: &ldquo;Do you wish to return to Pluto?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer she stepped closely to Zopyrus&rsquo; side
and clung tenaciously to his arm. He gazed long into
the depths of eyes that matched the blue of her gown
and the sapphires upon her brow. The color mounted
to her temples, and as she bowed her head he noticed
that the rosy flush likewise suffused her neck and
shoulders which were partially visible through the
golden strands of loosened hair.</p>
<p>Ephialtes was infuriated by Persephone&rsquo;s refusal
to return to him, and was nonplussed as to what method
he had best employ to obtain the maiden, when there
flashed through his mind the words of a sentence: &ldquo;On
the day that you deliver to Greece the traitor of
Thermopyl&aelig;, I will become your wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Straightening himself to his full height Ephialtes
commanded the attention of the audience.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am about to make a revelation that will return
Ariadne to me, I believe,&rdquo; he said smiling with
arrogant confidence. &ldquo;The man to whom Ariadne
clings and is no doubt one of our oarsmen, is no other
than he who betrayed your country to the Persians before
the battle of Thermopyl&aelig;. Greece has long sought
him fellow countrymen, and yonder he stands, defiling
with his touch the maiden who plays the part of Persephone
at the Mysteries of Eleusis. What will you do
with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kill him!&rdquo; came the cry from hundreds of
throats, and with one accord the angry mob rushed
toward Zopyrus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just one moment please,&rdquo; said Ephialtes. &ldquo;I
will wait for Ariadne, or Persephone of Eleusis, to
join me on the throne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused impressively, but Persephone did not
move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; he cried in indignation, &ldquo;Did you not
promise to become my bride when Thermopyl&aelig;&rsquo;s
traitor would be revealed by me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Persephone walked slowly toward Ephialtes who
stretched forth eager arms to receive her, but she
stopped a few paces before him and on her face was
an inscrutable smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast, Ephialtes. I want the proof. You
dare not make such a statement without sufficient evidence
against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ephialtes was confused. He had not had enough
time to make up false testimony, but he knew that his
future happiness depended now upon how successfully
he placed the blame of his guilt upon the innocent man
before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I will tell you the circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your testimony can avail naught, for my protector
here is a native Persian who knows nothing of
the mountain passes of Greece,&rdquo; said Persephone in
a voice that rang clearly as a bell through the great
hall. A death-like stillness pervaded the <i>cella</i>; nought
was heard but the sharp intake of Ephialtes&rsquo; breath,
then from his lips there burst in stentorian tones: &ldquo;If
this be true, a Persian in our midst is as deserving of
death as a traitor! Friends will you allow him even
so much as to touch the Persephone of the Mysteries?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Persephone became alarmed and feared
lest in her ardent desire to defend her protector, she
had only made matters worse. Zopyrus, seeing her
agitated countenance, smiled reassuringly and raised
his arm to command general attention. A few rabid
revelers rushed forward to do violence to his person
but were checked by a voice in the throng: &ldquo;Hear him!
No man should be condemned without being permitted
to say a word in his own behalf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The furious denunciations of the intolerant ones
subsided, and Zopyrus turned and walked slowly toward
Ephialtes who gradually retreated before the
compelling gaze of his antagonist, till he reached the
throne upon which he sat, quite unconscious of what
he did. Zopyrus&rsquo; demeanor changed instantly. He
bowed low before the amazed man upon the throne and
said with impressive solemnity:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;O Xerxes, King of the Medes and Persians and
would-be conqueror of the world, I come to you with
an important message. For two days your soldiers
have been defeated by the Greeks at the entrance of
the pass of Thermopyl&aelig;. The Greeks are so inferior
in number that right now is the time to strike, but not
in the method heretofore employed. The Greeks are
well trained, and if they are to be conquered, it must
be by the greater forces of the enemy. Listen, O
Xerxes! If you would succeed in overwhelming the
enemy, you must attack from behind, but this you can
not do since you are not acquainted with this wild, impassable
country. I am a native Malian and well acquainted
with this locality. If you will make it worth
my while, I will show you a mountain pass that will
lead you to the rear of Leonidas&rsquo; army unobserved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the Persian&rsquo;s recital, Ephialtes&rsquo; behavior
had undergone many mutations. From startled curiosity
to fearful apprehension, thence to genuine fright
and finally to abject terror, his demeanor had rapidly
changed. By the time the Persian had ceased speaking,
the Greek&rsquo;s face was as livid as a corpse.</p>
<p>Zopyrus sprang to the side of the doomed man
and clutching him by either shoulder cried, &ldquo;Speak,
traitor of Thermopyl&aelig;. What have you to say for
yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer Ephialtes drew from the folds of his
robe a ruby handled dagger which he raised for a
death-dealing thrust at Zopyrus, but the latter, free
from the influence of wine, was the quicker, and caught
his enemy&rsquo;s arm in its lightning-like descent, thus
warding off the blow that might have been fatal.</p>
<p>A muttering that grew to a rumble and then to a
mighty roar that shook the very pillars of the temple
was heard, and with one impulse an angry mob rushed
toward the dais. Above the din and confusion a voice
screamed: &ldquo;Death to the traitor who opened the gateway
to Greece! Upon his head and no other rests the
loss of our homes and the deaths of our fathers and
brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>Zopyrus drew the half fainting form of Persephone
to his side and with one strong arm gave her bodily
support and with the other forced a passage through
the enraged crowd down the length of the <i>cella</i>. At
the door they turned and looked back toward the throne
which was completely hidden from their sight by the
oscillating wave of humanity which hovered about it
and its ill-fated occupant.</p>
<p>Shuddering with horror they rushed out into the
darkness. The cool breeze from across the water revived
their benumbed senses. As they sped along the
pathway which led to the shore, the drunken figure of
a man emerged from a clump of bushes to their left.
Zopyrus would have ordinarily paid no heed, as the
man was in type a duplicate of hundreds of others
within the temple, but something familiar in the drunkard&rsquo;s
appearance caused him to pause and take a second
look, and in doing so he recognized beyond the
question of a doubt the coarse companion of Corinna.
His conscience smote him as he remembered that although
he had come to Naxos for the very purpose of
serving as Corinna&rsquo;s protector, he had abandoned her
to whatever fate might befall when he had seen Persephone
in distress.</p>
<p>He seized Persephone&rsquo;s hand and said hastily:
&ldquo;Come with me. We must find Corinna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean Corinna the daughter of the poet
Pasicles?&rdquo; asked Persephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;Do you know her?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>The girl nodded. The young man continued talking
as they hurried on in the direction whence the
rough man had appeared. &ldquo;She came to Naxos in the
company of that brutish-looking man we met and I
intended to protect her, but you know the result! When
I saw you, you were in dire need of help and I could
no more have left you to suffer at the hands of that
traitor than I did that day on the Acropolis when the
Persian, Artabazus would have harmed you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned half timidly to her, ashamed of his
adoration for her whom he now had no right to desire;
for the image of a pure and noble maiden stood between
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me how you knew Ephialtes to be the man
who betrayed Greece at Thermopyl&aelig;,&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Zopyrus related in detail the episode of his eavesdropping
in the tent of Xerxes, and Persephone was
about to tell why Ephialtes had been so eager to accuse
someone of being the traitor at Thermopyl&aelig;, when a
white form, partially concealed by undergrowth a few
paces before them, attracted their attention simultaneously.</p>
<p>Zopyrus sprang ahead and dropped to his knees
beside the prone figure of a girl which he discovered
lay in the stillness of death. Something cold seemed
to grip his heart and everything about him seemed to
melt into a whirling cloud! With a faint cry of anguish
he lost consciousness just as Persephone ran up to him.
She bent over him and looked into the lifeless face of
the girl.</p>
<p>It was Corinna, the daughter of Pasicles!</p>

<p class="t0">And left me in shadow here!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="lr">Tennyson.</p>
</div>
<p>The god Hymen did not have charge of the ceremonies
at the home of Pasicles: the goddess
Mors officiated in his stead! Corinna was laid
away in her eternal rest, and the house and garden that
had often echoed the sound of her gay laughter were
silent! Even the boy Mimnermus, tip-toed about in
awful solitude, gravely impressed by this, his first
experience with death.</p>
<p>Polygnotus was a daily visitor, whose calm dignity
combined with his kindly sympathy, made him an
ever welcome one. For Zopyrus he felt a genuine love
which had but recently developed from his former fellowship
and friendly regard. One an artist, the other
a poet by natural inclination, they understood each
other upon the ground of their common adoration for
all that was beautiful and true and good whether represented
by picture or by word.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>One day, several weeks after the tragic occurrences
at Naxos, Zopyrus happened to come upon the letter
which his beloved friend, Aeschylus, had written him
from Sicily, and it reminded him of the poet&rsquo;s request
that he visit his young son at Eleusis, so without further
delay he set out mounted upon a richly caparisoned
steed, lent him for the occasion by Cimon. As he
passed through the Dipylon Gate he became aware for
the first time that heavy storm clouds were rapidly
gathering ahead of him, but having arrived thus far on
his journey, he did not wish to return. The broad road
that always stretched peacefully into the distance a
winding silver band, was now hazy with whirling eddies
of dust; and the usually tranquil branches of the olive
trees on either side were bending and swaying under
the force which Boreas exerted upon them.</p>
<p>The storm with all it fury did not burst upon him
till he had passed the fountain of Kallichoros at which
place he might have secured shelter. With his eyes on
distant Eleusis he pressed on toward his goal gradually
becoming unmindful of his soaking garments, and of the
fact that a numbness was taking possession of his faculties.</p>
<p>Aeschylus had once described his home to Zopyrus
as being the first abode west of the great temple, and
Zopyrus gasped with delight as the classical outlines
of a home typical of the upper-class citizen of Attica
burst upon his sight. A high wall enclosing a garden
space lay between the temple precinct and the home of
the poet. As he entered the gate, a life-sized statue of
the goddess Demeter, bearing in her arm a sheaf of
corn stood at the edge of the garden to his right, and
near by in marble stood the cheerful fun-loving figure
of the faithful Iambe, who sought to alleviate her
mistress&rsquo; sorrow. But that which caught his eye and
held it was a fountain in the center of which was a
most artistic composition representing the rape of
Persephone. The faces chiselled in the cold marble
were so like the faces of Ephialtes and Persephone that
Zopyrus stood spellbound, unmindful of the fact that
a slave was approaching him and bidding him enter,
saying that his horse would be placed at once in the
stable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>Zopyrus approached the door and found himself
gazing into the half curious, half laughing face of a lad
of sixteen, who said while he gripped Zopyrus&rsquo; arm
heartily: &ldquo;I know who you are, for father told me you
were coming. But pray why did you choose such a
day as this in which to pay a call?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take it that you are Euphorion, the son of my
most esteemed friend. I did not expect the storm to
break so soon, or I should not have undertaken the
trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Euphorion surveyed his guest&rsquo;s wet garments with
disfavor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must get into dry clothes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
are shuddering now with the cold. Lycambes,&rdquo; he
called to a servant, &ldquo;take this man to my father&rsquo;s
room and give him dry clothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zopyrus emerged from the upper chamber dry but
not comfortable, for his head felt as though a fire
burned in his brain, while his hands and feet were
numb. Euphorion had disappeared and in his stead a
young girl in white sat on the edge of the marble basin
of a fountain, industriously engaged in a work of embroidery.
She looked up as Zopyrus entered and the
latter as his eyes rested on her, thought he must be
suffering delirium, for it seemed he beheld Persephone!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>Zopyrus moistened his lips and he cleared his
throat so that his voice would be audible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you and what are you doing here?&rdquo; he
asked scarcely above a whisper.</p>
<p>The girl laughed coyly and toyed for a moment
with her piece of fancy-work while Zopyrus advanced
toward her a step. Then she raised her blue eyes in
whose depths Zopyrus read the same love-message that
he had at Salamis and at the Mysteries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am exactly who I appear to be,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
am Persephone of Eleusis. This is my home and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zopyrus, eyes bright with the unnatural luster of
a fever, echoed her words as she finished: &ldquo;Aeschylus
is my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She threw back her head and tossed her curls and
before she realized what was about to happen, Zopyrus
held her in his arms, kissing her again and again the
while he murmured: &ldquo;I love you Persephone, but I am
a Persian and must return to the encampment at
Phalerum. Salamis is saved&mdash;listen to the Hymn to
Dionysus! Can you find your way in safety to your
people?&mdash;Hear the chant&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Persephone felt his hold upon her relax, and
though she tried to keep him from falling, he slipped
from her grasp and sank unconscious to the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Euphorion! Euphorion!&rdquo; screamed the terrified
girl. &ldquo;He is ill! Call Lycambes and together you must
carry him to father&rsquo;s chamber and there make him
comfortable till I can summon a physician.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>His exposure to the storm, and the shock of finding
Persephone and learning her identity, had proved
too much for Zopyrus in his state of mental depression
and low ebb of vitality due to the Naxian tragedy. For
days he lay upon the couch of Aeschylus alternating
between chills and raging fever. In his delirium he
raved, and his listeners wondered at the names of
Persephone and Eumetis heard interchangeably to fall
from his lips. Pasicles, Cleodice and Eumetis were
frequent visitors till the crisis was past and Zopyrus
was a convalescent.</p>
<p>Upon one occasion a few days before Zopyrus expected
to be able to undertake the journey back to
Athens, he and Persephone were seated in the garden.
The statues of Ceres and Iambe stood in their accustomed
places, but the Hades and Persephone had
disappeared. Zopyrus asked no question for he felt
that Persephone was fully justified in her dislike for
that particular work of art, beautiful though it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he said as they gazed across the ivy-covered
wall to where the sun&rsquo;s rays illumined the top
of the temple, &ldquo;is your name really Persephone, or are
you so called because of your part in the Mysteries?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My parents named me Persephone, hoping even
at my birth that some day I would play the part of
Persephone in the temple. I have fulfilled their hopes
in that respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are adorable in the part, little Persephone,
and some time a real Pluto will come and carry you off
to his realm. If I&mdash;that is&mdash;sometime&mdash;Oh, Persephone,
I have no right to say it, but I adore you, and
if you will consent to marry me, I will arrange other
matters that might interfere.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I know the &lsquo;other matters,&rsquo; Zopyrus,&rdquo;
said the girl, not daring to meet his gaze. &ldquo;Eumetis
loves you, and there has been some understanding between
you. Go to her&mdash;but, oh my dear, my dear,
how can I stand it&mdash;yet I have said it. Go and keep
your vows to her. She will make you a good wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A good wife,&rsquo;&rdquo; groaned Zopyrus in mental
agony. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want &lsquo;a good wife.&rsquo; I want the
woman whom I love heart and soul!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose and though weak and unsteady of step
he advanced toward her with outstretched arms, but
she evaded his touch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think Zopyrus,&rdquo; she entreated. &ldquo;Can you not
recall your advances of love to Eumetis? They were
promises, and must not be broken!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood with head bent upon his breast and hands
clenched till the nails pierced his palms. When he
looked up his passion-distorted features were calm and
his voice was steady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right. My first duty is the happiness
of the pure girl who lost her sister through my neglect.
And you Persephone,&rdquo; his voice and features again
showed deep agitation, &ldquo;do not know that you lost a
brother, not through my neglect, but by my intention.
Your brother fell at Thermopyl&aelig; pierced by my sword!
The first time I ever saw you I knew that you were his
sister.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;Phales!&rdquo; cried the poor girl, raising tear-dimmed
eyes to heaven, &ldquo;my twin brother! Why did your
spirit not warn me that this man who dared think of
me in love was your murderer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not murderer,&rdquo; cried Zopyrus in deep anguish.
&ldquo;Do not say that! I did it in the heat of battle and in
self-defense. I am no murderer and my conscience does
not reproach me for what happened at Thermopyl&aelig;.
Listen&mdash;Persephone!&rdquo; But he stood in the garden
alone.</p>

<p>The opportunity for meetings between Cimon and
Ladice had been very rare since the former
wished as far as possible to avoid meeting
Themistocles. The young man had conscientiously endeavored
to rectify the harm that he had done against
the older man, but the populace preferred to believe the
evil charge which was still vigorously promoted by
Leobotes and other newly-won conspirators.</p>
<p>One afternoon Cimon walked briskly into the curio
shop of Aphobus. The little merchant was dusting
with loving care, delicate vases in ivory and bronze of
intricate designs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This vase,&rdquo; he said, picking up a small urn in
terra-cotta with figures and designs painted in black,
&ldquo;has depicted upon it in minutest detail the story of
the siege of Troy. Here we see Paris presenting
Aphrodite with the apple. There he is carrying away
the beautiful Helen. And here,&rdquo; he added delightedly,
&ldquo;is the wooden horse of Ulysses. How very&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>&ldquo;I did not come here to discuss the Trojan war,&rdquo;
said Cimon abruptly. &ldquo;I came to find out if there is
any truth to the rumor that Themistocles has disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Aphobus could reply, the entrance to the
shop was darkened by another figure. Both men upon
looking up perceived it to be Lysimachus, son of Aristides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard the news?&rdquo; he cried, and upon
receiving negative responses, continued. &ldquo;Themistocles
has left Greece and it is believed that he has gone
to Persia!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cimon could venture no response but he listened
dully to the details as related by the son of Themistocles&rsquo;
former rival. But one question kept throbbing
in his brain: &ldquo;Will she marry me now that Themistocles
has gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He realized presently that Lysimachus was addressing
him personally. &ldquo;I hear that the allied fleet
leaves tomorrow on its first expedition since the formation
of the Delian Confederacy, with you as its commander
in which capacity you succeed my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes we set sail on the morrow for Thrace to free
from Persian rule the town of Eion on the river
Strymon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aphobus gazed with approbation at the manly
form of Cimon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have known you since you were a little boy,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;and I am proud to see you the first man in
Athens. This expedition is a noble enterprise, but
take care that while you are gone others right here in
the city do not arise to seek your position. I have in
mind a certain youth named Pericles. To be sure he
is not the soldier that you are, but he is a patron of
the arts and is interested in beautifying Athens, as
very little of that has been done since the war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not fear Pericles,&rdquo; answered Cimon.
&ldquo;Athens is more interested at present in the results of
the recent formation of the Delian League which pertain
more directly to our colonies. After these troubles
are settled there will be time for the future rebuilding
of the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cimon took his leave of Aphobus and Lysimachus
and had gone but a few steps when he met Leobotes.
He wished to hurry on after a short nod of greeting,
but Leobotes stopped him with the words: &ldquo;Congratulations,
Cimon, Themistocles has fled and now there is
none before you in Athens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my opinion Themistocles is fortunate to be
away from the immediate influence of the intrigues of
certain so-called &lsquo;loyal citizens.&rsquo; The fate of Ephialtes
should prove a warning to such,&rdquo; with which words
he walked away from Leobotes who was too much
astonished to reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>At last he had opportunity to think! So the fiery
statesman, Themistocles, was gone, and he, Cimon, had
been instrumental in bringing this about! Well he
knew that he had done his utmost to prevent this toward
the last. He had humbled himself that Themistocles
might not be thought guilty of treason, and
all this was for the purpose of obtaining the girl he
loved. He realized that whether by force of will or
unconsciously he was drawing nearer and nearer to the
home of Themistocles. He paused before the entrance,
ascended the steps and lifted the bronze knocker.
There was no response, so he gently pushed open the
door and entered. All was still. He proceeded
cautiously to the solarium and found it empty, but from
this room the faint sound of voices came to his listening
ear. They proceeded from the garden, so thither he
betook himself. From the top of a short flight of
stone steps which led to the garden, he surveyed the
abundance of plants and shrubbery which he thought
surpassed even those in the garden of Pasicles. He
caught sight of two female figures seated upon a bench
at the farther end of the garden. They were Ladice
and Asia, the youngest daughter of Themistocles. The
girls seemed to be indulging in mutual consolation.</p>
<p>A vague uneasiness that foreboded no good hovered
about Cimon as he approached with the words: &ldquo;Do I
intrude?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ladice shook her head while Asia arose, hastily
excused herself and entered the house.</p>
<p>Cimon took the place that Asia had occupied and
said gently: &ldquo;Ladice, you can not believe how I regret
what has happened. Believe that I did all within my
power to prevent this ever since our meeting in the
shadow of the Acropolis. I have come to take you with
me, Ladice. I sail in the morning for Thrace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will go alone,&rdquo; she replied drawing
away from him. &ldquo;Do you think for one moment that
I will be the wife of the man who helped to cause the
ruin of one whose home has sheltered me for many
months? You failed in accomplishing your part of the
agreement; I do not have to abide by mine!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>Cimon&rsquo;s face grew pale and his jaw acquired the
peculiar set appearance of indomitability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble with me,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;is that I have
been too gentle, too lenient with you. My patience is
exhausted and I am going to take you by force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He caught her and held her close, though she
struggled to free herself from his almost brutal kisses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to take you as the men of the mountain
countries take their wives,&rdquo; he whispered fiercely,
and she felt his hot breath upon her cheek.</p>
<p>Frantically she struggled to gain her freedom,
succeeding at times in striking sharp blows upon his
face, but still he held her in a vise-like grip. Her desperate
struggles merely strengthened his determination
to conquer her, but when she realized the impotence
of her resistance, she resorted to the use of the most
effective weapon a woman can employ. In scathing
tones she reminded him of the dissipations of his youth,
of the disgrace of his father and ended with a direct
accusation of the ostracism of Themistocles, thus denying
any belief in the assurances with which he had
opened conversation with her upon entering the garden.
Suddenly his hold relaxed. He pushed her from him
and arose from the bench and there was a cold glint in
the eyes that a moment before had burned with the
light of desire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said, and his tones were clearly
cut and even, &ldquo;the fair Agariste to whom my attentions
are not unwelcome will accompany me to Thrace.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>He turned and left her, a pitiful drooping figure.
Her posture remained the same for some moments
after he had gone, and so preoccupied was she that she
did not hear Asia re-enter the garden and seat herself
beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor dear girl, that man is a brute,&rdquo; remarked
Asia indignantly. &ldquo;At any rate you can rejoice
that he will molest you no more. I could not help
hearing some of the things he said, and I hope he and
his Agariste will meet no delays in getting away from
Athens. Why do you not laugh at your good fortune,
foolish girl? One would think from your crestfallen
appearance that you loved the man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ladice looked up and smiled faintly through her
tears as she said, &ldquo;Asia, I believe I do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do love him! that beast that makes three-headed
Cerberus look like a lamb!&rdquo; cried Asia.
&ldquo;Ladice, you must be crazy! Grief over my poor
father and the excitement of the past hour have unbalanced
your mind. Come let me get you to bed,
though there is yet another hour before set of sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Asia, I could not rest,&rdquo; said the grief-stricken
girl. &ldquo;Please leave me. The garden is so beautiful
and I wish to be alone with my thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Asia left her reluctantly making her promise to
retire early.</p>
<p>Once more alone Ladice marvelled at the change
that had come over her. From a cold, indifferent girl
she had changed into a passionate, loving woman. The
love must have come when she lay helpless in his arms,
she reasoned, but it was not a vital thing till he spoke
the words that stung her pride. How different was this
love from that which she had felt for the Persian,
Masistius! That had been like a clear and steady light;
this was a fire that leaped wildly while it consumed.
At times she smiled at the memory of his kisses, then
clenched her hands as she thought of the unknown
Agariste.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>Darkness fell but she took no food, and worn out
with weeping she dropped into a dreamless sleep. She
awoke with a sense of depression. It was dawn and
birds were twittering in their nests about her. It was
apparent from the silence that the household was still
wrapped in slumber. Gathering her shawl more closely
about her she made her way cautiously through the
house to the street. Along narrow lanes she threaded
her way with unnatural rapidity. She ran between
mud-colored walls that rose on either side, punctuated
with doors out of which stared disheveled women. Piles
of rotting garbage lay in her path and she was forced
to dodge now this way, now that, to avoid the slinking
forms of dogs that were seeking food among the piles
of refuse. As she neared the vicinity of the harbor she
met men and women who looked at her curiously. Then
she realized what an aspect she presented; wild-eyed
and with unkempt hair, but she cared naught for her
appearance. She was obsessed with one idea; to present
herself a willing companion to Cimon on his
journey.</p>
<p>On the quay she approached a woman, apparently
of the upper class, who with many others was gazing
steadfastly out at sea, with the words, &ldquo;When does the
fleet said for Thrace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer the woman pointed to the distant
horizon where a few indistinct blots were barely discernible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>&ldquo;It sailed before sunrise,&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;I
came to see it off because the great commander Cimon
honored our family by taking my daughter Agariste
with him as his bride.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">The Hand of Fate.</span></h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Before he mounts the hill, I know</p>
<p class="t0">He cometh quickly; from below</p>
<p class="t0">Sweet gales, as from deep gardens, blow</p>
<p class="t0">Before him, striking on my brow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="lr">Tennyson.</p>
</div>
<p>Days lengthened into weeks, and weeks into
months. The fate of Corinna had lost none of
its horror, but time had mollified the poignancy
of the tragedy. Zopyrus still served as secretary to
Pasicles and in his spare moments he wrote a series of
essays entitled, &ldquo;Memoirs of the Persian Court,&rdquo;
which he intended to present to the great Aeschylus as
an aid to that poet in his poem the &ldquo;Pers&aelig;&rdquo; upon which
he was working.</p>
<p>Considering himself to be unworthy because of
his secret passion for the daughter of Aeschylus, he
had for some weeks delayed speaking to Eumetis upon
the subject of marriage, but one bright afternoon in
March when the bird-winds blew across Attica from
the Mediterranean, he asked her to join him in a stroll
to the Acropolis. She gladly consented, and together
they sauntered along the winding street westward toward
the hill which rose in majesty before them, the
pride of every loyal Athenian.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let us rest on yonder moss-covered ledge,&rdquo; suggested
Eumetis as they neared the eastern end of the
Acropolis. &ldquo;Later we can ascend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; exclaimed Zopyrus hastily, recognizing
the very place where he had seen Corinna and the base
creature who had accompanied her. &ldquo;Let us to
the Theatre of Dionysus where we sat together and
witnessed &lsquo;The Capture of Miletus.&rsquo; It was there you
first&mdash;&rdquo; but he could not conclude the sentence and
walked along by Eumetis&rsquo; side, his eyes downcast with
shame that his tongue had faltered just at the moment
when he desired to bring up the subject of their
betrothal.</p>
<p>They entered the eastern gate of the theatre and
before them rose the stone seats, tier upon tier, dazzling
white in the heat of the sun. They were impressed by
the awful silence which here reigned supreme. What
a vast difference between the theatre now and as it
was on that day when thousands of spectators had
thronged its gates and had sat in gala attire upon its
benches! Then it had surged with human life; now
the only living things visible were occasional lizards
darting in and out of crevices.</p>
<p>Zopyrus and Eumetis without a word, but with a
mutual impulse, sought the section of seats at the head
of which stood the statue of Aphrodite. For some
moments they sat in silence with eyes fixed upon the
stage as if before them they saw again enacted the
great play of Phrynichus. But her hand did not touch
his arm as upon that former occasion. There existed
an inexplicable estrangement, and Zopyrus as he
noticed her pensive mood revealed in her pale features,
was smitten with remorse that he had neglected and
undoubtedly wounded her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;Eumetis,&rdquo; he said softly, &ldquo;do not think that I
have been willfully neglectful of you. Much has occurred
to turn our minds from our&mdash;our&mdash;happiness.
Will you now once again set the date for our wedding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no response from Eumetis. He seized
her hands which lay passively folded in her lap. They
were cold. Her attitude was listless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak, Eumetis,&rdquo; the youth implored with growing
alarm. &ldquo;Have I offended you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At his words of entreaty the girl turned her face
toward him and smiled&mdash;but not as a maiden would
smile at her lover, but as a mother would gaze upon a
beloved but willful son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not offended me, Zopyrus, and I sincerely
hope that what I am about to say will not hurt
you. Do you believe, my friend, that I honor you most
highly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded affirmatively and she continued, her
thoughtful, sincere eyes resting upon him contemplatively:
&ldquo;Then I will tell you why I have seemed
strange. I love Polygnotus who returns my affection,
and but for the fear of wounding you, a friend whom
he holds most dear, would wed me now at any time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>The stage, the theatre, the Acropolis, and even
the fleecy clouds floating dreamily above, seemed to
whirl about in a colorless eddy. Only the eyes of
Eumetis remained stationary. At one moment they
seemed to be accusing eyes, at another, reproachful,
then pitying, but his last impression of them was that
they portrayed peace and happiness. His conscience
would not permit him to play the heroically sacrificing
lover, nor did he really experience any elation because
of his freedom. He simply clasped her hand and murmured:
&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo; She looked at him quickly
with a questioning glance as they rose and turned their
faces homeward.</p>
<p>Before they reached the western limit of the
Agora, the familiar figure of Polygnotus suddenly
turned from a side street and came toward them.
Zopyrus imagined that a fleeting expression of pain
passed over the artist&rsquo;s kindly face at sight of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eumetis has something important to say to you,&rdquo;
said Zopyrus laying a hand on his friend&rsquo;s shoulder
as the three met. &ldquo;It is only good news,&rdquo; he added at
the startled look of inquiry upon Polygnotus&rsquo; face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I shall be glad to hear it, but will you not
join us on our homeward way, Zopyrus?&rdquo; asked the
artist as Zopyrus turned to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for the present,&rdquo; Zopyrus replied evasively.
Then moved by a sudden impulse he seized a hand of
Polygnotus and of Eumetis in each of his. He desired
to invoke the blessing of the gods upon this couple
whom he loved so dearly, but so deeply was he affected
that he was unable to speak, and turned his back in
the direction of the theatre, scarcely realizing what he
was doing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>Before reaching the Acropolis he turned northward,
pursuing as direct a course as possible along the
winding, closely built streets, till at last the dwellings
became more interspersed with garden-plots, and
finally between two spreading acacias he spied the massive
masonry of the Dipylon Gate. He turned back
for one last look at the Acropolis. There it stood in
its solitary grandeur, its ruined temples resembling a
circlet of irregular pearls. Although this was the fifth
time that he had passed through the great gate and
along the Sacred Way, never until now had he known
that this road led to the girl he loved. Unmindful of
the scorching rays of the sun which beat down upon
him, he pressed on thinking only of the goal. When,
however, he was overtaken by a farmer in a cart who
was returning to his farm near Eleusis after leaving
his produce at the Athenian market, he gladly accepted
an offer to ride.</p>
<p>The sun was approaching the horizon a little to the
left of the travelers, and stretching into the distance
were the fertile fields which the driver designated as
his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is where I live, my friend, but I can drive
you on to Eleusis if you wish,&rdquo; said the farmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would prefer to walk from here on,&rdquo; replied
Zopyrus hastily, &ldquo;but I am truly grateful to you for
driving me this far on my journey.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>He bade the man a friendly farewell and with eyes
alight with anticipation, set forth to cover the remaining
two miles which lay between him and the abode of
the girl he loved.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>In the garden that was divided from the Temple
of Mysteries only by an ivy-covered wall, reclined
Persephone upon a cushion covered seat by the fountain.
She did not sleep, but lay fully conscious, with
her hands upon her bosom as it rose and fell regularly
with her breathing. Her whole frame was wrapped in
languor. But her face was not as expressive of peace
as her body, for an occasional frown puckered her
smooth brow and she opened her eyes with a wistful
expression only to close them again as if to shut out
the reality of her loneliness. Between two cypress trees
the white roof of the temple showed the first rosy
tinge that followed the passing of Ph&oelig;bus Apollo&mdash;Persephone
rose to a sitting posture; a figure in white
had passed the gate and was coming toward her along
the flower-bordered path. With a cry she sprang from
her bench and ran into the outstretched arms of her
lover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of Eumetis?&rdquo; she asked, attempting to
draw away from the arms that encircled her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eumetis has found happiness in the love of
Polygnotus. It was inevitable that the artist could be
such a frequent visitor at the home of Pasicles and not
grow to love the sincere, unselfish, pure daughter who
lives there. Oh&mdash;Persephone, have I your forgiveness
for the death of your brother?&rdquo; asked the young man
with growing agitation.</p>
<p>The maiden&rsquo;s face lit up with a divine radiance as
she said: &ldquo;My brother Phales clad as I last saw him
with helmet, cuirass and greaves, and carrying his
sword, quiver and shield, appeared to me in a dream
and told me not to hold you guilty of his death. He
praised you highly, Zopyrus&mdash;and then he said one
more thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what was that?&rdquo; questioned her lover
eagerly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;There is but one God who controls and
directs the universe.&rsquo; That is all he said. I would have
asked him more, but he vanished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the prayer to God saved Greece at Salamis,
and incessant prayers to the one God have given me
you, Persephone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She raised her lips to his as they stood together
before the statue of Ceres, whose maternal countenance
seemed to smile down benignly upon them despite their
words concerning the Deity.</p>
<p>There was one other witness to that kiss; a man
of middle-age with thick waving hair and beard of
chestnut brown, who came forth from the house and,
unobserved, stood with arms outstretched toward the
two as if pronouncing a benediction.</p>

<p class="lr">Winthrop Mackworth Pr&aelig;d.</p>
</div>
<p>To Themistocles in Magnesia, greetings
from Zopyrus at Gela in Sicily:&mdash;</p>
<p>After a silence of many years I write you
again of affairs of state and even of many personal
things which I know will be of interest to you. I want
to assure you, my friend that I have never doubted
your true loyalty to Athens, and I write you freely
knowing that Greece is dearer to you than Persia. Your
memory is and always will be in the hearts of the
majority, for who can forget the glories of Salamis and
the hero to whom we owe that victory!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>Would that you could once more behold Athens&mdash;our
Athens&mdash;and yet not as she was in the years that
you, my dear friend, walked her streets, stood in her
buzzing mart, or ascended her divine hill. The crystalline
air, the song of the nightingale in the olive groves,
the shaggy peak of Hymettus, the blue of the bay, and
the familiar rose-tinted rock of the Acropolis&mdash;these
the Persian has been unable to destroy.</p>
<p>Your once hated rival Aristides is dead. I know
that though bitter enmity once filled your heart, you
will regret to hear that he died so poor that he was
buried at the public expense. After his death Cimon
became undisputed leader, and greatly has Athens been
benefitted by the rule of this brilliant man whom we
knew well as a youth. But alas, for the brevity of
popular favor! But a few years ago he was ostracized
by the most talked of man in all Athens today, Pericles,
son of Xanthippus. On the eve of the battle of Tanagra,
Cimon left his place of banishment and fought
bravely with the Athenians against the Spartans. This
so pleased Pericles that he proposed a measure recalling
Cimon from exile and it was passed by the
assembly. Cimon has succeeded in putting down many
revolts, and you know of his great victory over the Persians
in Asia. From the proceeds from the spoils of
this battle he had planned to build a temple to Athena,
but this work is being carried on by Pericles. It is
plain that Cimon, however sincerely he had the welfare
of his city at heart, was too fond of personal praise
and worship. He failed in his attempt to unite Athens
and Sparta. Pericles stands for the independence of
Athens and for pure democracy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>During the Thasian Revolt about ten years ago,
Mimnermus distinguished himself by bravery, but he
confided to us that he did not relish the task of overseeing
the Thacians tear down their walls at the command
of the Athenians, for his brother-in-law, Polygnotus,
was a native of Thasos. Mimnermus is now at
Aegina helping to suppress a similar revolt.</p>
<p>And now I will tell you of Polygnotus. He and
other artists adorned the interior of the Painted Porch
with mural pictures of great beauty representing
scenes from the myths and from recent history.
Polygnotus married Eumetis, the daughter of Pasicles,
and to this union were born three daughters, Corinna,
Cleodice and Neobule. Pasicles resides with his daughter
and her husband, but his wife, Cleodice, whose
health failed rapidly after the death of her daughter,
Corinna, died within a few years after that tragic event.</p>
<p>I know it will interest you to hear of Ladice and
Lysimachus, both of whom spoke of you affectionately
whenever we met while in Athens. Their son, Aristides,
in whom they feel the usual pride common to parents
of an only child, gives promise of exceptional
ability along the lines of his grandfather, and if I may
say so, his foster-grandparent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>Yesterday I stood at a newly made grave on the
banks of a river which pours its waters into the African
Sea. In the distance to the north stretched the wheat-bearing
land of Gela. Before I could give my thoughts
wholly to the honored dead, I gazed with pride and
happiness upon the family with which I have been
blessed. My eldest son Phales, stood by my side, stalwart
of body and thoughtful of mind, not unlike his
grandfather, Aeschylus. Persephone, our eldest daughter
is very like her mother was at her age, so it is
needless to mention here the pride I feel in her. My
second son Masistius, at times reminds me of my
father, Artaphernes, but the loving guidance of his
mother has softened the severity that was his grandfather&rsquo;s.
The youngest child, a daughter, Protomache,
stood upon this occasion with tears in her usually
laughing eyes. She clung tightly to the hand of her
mother whose eyes rested lovingly upon each member
of the little group in turn.</p>
<p>Then in low tones and with head bent in a reverent
attitude, Persephone my dear wife, read this epitaph
which was engraved upon the tomb:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;This tomb the dust of Aeschylus doth hide&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Euphorion&rsquo;s son and fruitful Gela&rsquo;s pride;</p>
<p class="t0">How famed his valor Marathon may tell,</p>
<p class="t0">And long-haired Medes, who knew it all too well.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>As the last word trembled into a silence that
seemed to permeate Nature all about us, a few lines
that had been composed by Aeschylus on the subject
of death, came to my mind, and I could not but repeat
them upon this occasion:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Smitten by Him, from towering hopes degraded,</p>
<p class="t2">Mortals lie low and still;</p>
<p class="t0">Tireless and effortless works forth its will</p>
<p class="t2">The arm divine!</p>
<p class="t0">God from His holy seat, in calm of unarmed power,</p>
<p class="t0">Brings forth the deed at its appointed hour!&rdquo;</p>
